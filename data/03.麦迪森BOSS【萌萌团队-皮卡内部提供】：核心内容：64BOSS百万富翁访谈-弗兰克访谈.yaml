    the guy that I've met three years ago。，Three years ago， yeah。，Okay。，We met on
    just。I see him around a lot randomly。，I think I met him actually in the back seat
    of a car。。As a random place with Max。，Yeah， as a Max。，We went out with Max。。I
    met him in the back seat of a car。，And as I came to know more about him，。I just
    thought he was a very interesting person。，So Frank。he'll tell you a little bit
    more about himself，，but some of his major accomplishments so far。is that he has
    a company that's doing very， very well。，It's， I guess you would say。one of the
    top 100？，Yeah， one of the top 30 fastest growing companies in Canada。。We've got
    40 employees or so。，We've really been growing a lot in the last five years。。And
    it's just a job that， or an occupation，，a company that just allows me to live
    a lifestyle。that I really enjoy。，I get to spend a lot of time with my family，，with
    my friends。work on myself a lot。，So it's just cultivating kind of like a lifestyle。and
    having that company that allows you，to pursue other things。，Cool。。And one of the
    coolest things about Frank too，is not even like， it's the company， right？。So I
    found out about the company later on，，but I noticed that Frank is very particular。in
    the way that he does things。，He's very， very particular and thoughtful。。Everything
    he does is thought through methodically，as a process before he executes it。。My

    the stuff in a certain way。，And that's one of the qualities that I noticed Frank
    had。，And then I learned about you and your company，only like， I don't know， like
    later on，。like maybe like eight months or a year later。，And it made sense。。And
    I noticed anybody who was successful in life，or in certain areas had those qualities。，You
    know？。So yeah， we'll just crack into it。，Just pass it back and forth。，There's
    a little chat here。。Can you tell me a little bit about like your upbringing？，So
    you know， you're here right now。。I guess we're like mid thirties。，That's the age
    we're going for at mid thirties。，Okay。，Mid thirties。the age you're going for。，Okay，
    cool。，Mid thirties。，And so before any of this stuff happened，。it happened to you
    later in life，，but there was a process that happened。，Like the origin story。like
    Batman almost， right？，Like the origin story。，What was the upbringing？。What were
    the beliefs that parents told you，or things you saw when you were growing up。that
    kind of made you say，，uh， you know， I'm here right now，。but there's a level of
    success that I want to achieve，that's higher or something I want to get to。or
    I think I can do more。，And also that like，，also would be like the turning point。。So
    it's kind of like the whole upbringing，

    up just outside of Toronto here，in the suburbs。。My parents worked。，My mom is like
    administrative assistant。。My dad works in industrial sales and service。，So pretty，
    you know， pretty regular jobs。。They instilled in this kind of like work ethic，where
    it was， you know， kind of take the safe route。in life。，And it's kind of the opposite
    of what I ended up doing。，But they're all about， you know。stability，and， you know，
    doing well in school，and getting a higher education，。which were good things to
    do。，But then later on，，I decided， you know， I should， you know，。take some risks
    as well。，The one thing in terms of schooling，that it was funny that my mom and
    dad。both instilled in me or more so my mom was，，you're doing it for yourself。。Like
    don't try to impress us。，It's different。，So the one thing was I'd come home。like
    from high school with，，I remember it was like， I don't know，，my report card was
    like 90 or 92。。And I was like， mom， look at this。，I'm so excited。，Like I got these
    great marks。，And she's like。so what？，She's like， why are you trying to impress
    us？，Why are you trying to show us？。Like you should be doing this for yourself。，So
    it kind of instilled， I took a step back。，I'm like。yeah， like I'm doing well in
    school。，I'm focusing on， you know，。getting to university and college and whatnot。，Because
    I'm doing it for me。，Not for anybody。not to impress anybody。，And that was kind

    and outside of school，，like four hours a day of just like，extracurricular stuff。。Of

    like this guy's movies are awesome。。He's really inspiring。，Just like his films
    are just so cool。，Like you're a kid。。You like love action movies， right？，So it
    was cool to see。，In terms of like business wise and stuff。。I never really had
    role models，that were like stars or anything，or famous people。。It was more my
    teachers that inspired me。，In school。，So I had teachers in science。and calculus
    that just pushed me，and pushed me so hard。，If I did poorly，they're like you know

    were like supportive，and believing in you。and pushing you，because I didn't have
    that，when I was a kid。，I had maybe a few。。But if you didn't have that，do you think

    of your business right now。，Let's talk about your first，startup。。I read in the
    article，or Facebook or something。，International site was $5，000。，And then from
    $5，000。the company grew。，So from $5，000，I guess it went through shifts as well。，How
    did you。I guess be flexible，and discover those shifts，that were possible to make。，Because
    the first idea。probably isn't the idea，that you ended up with right now。，That
    first idea。how did you guys get that going？，How did you get off the ground？，We，It
    was my buddy and I。when we first started，it was a product line，that he had a contact，was
    making a product in the US。。So we started basically，we picked up one product line，that
    we were selling。。But then we quickly found that，we needed to carry，multiple product
    lines，like in the niche。that we were servicing。，And then once we were buying，a
    bunch of products，from different suppliers。we said you know what，we need to make
    this ourselves。，We need to basically go to China。and design it here ourselves，just
    like kind of Apple，designs in California，manufactures overseas。。We kind of had
    the same idea。，We designed everything here，and made it overseas，

    for us。。But there was so much more involved。，There was the delivery of the product。，There
    was the marketing。of the product online。，There was reaching out to，the retail
    partners，that we wanted to sell through。。All these things that，that were part
    of that puzzle。，But just starting out，that advantage was like。taking that risk，and
    saying you know what，why can't we develop，a better product？，Why can't we just。start
    designing the product？，We really didn't have，any design background，but we knew
    what。the customers wanted。，So we kind of outsourced design。，We outsourced，some
    of the marketing。of the product。，But in the end，when it came down to it，it was
    us selling that product，to retailers。and they saw value，in what we were offering。，I

    their flaws are，and they have a strategy。to compensate for those flaws。，They think
    they're honest，about what their weaknesses are。and they either，surround themselves
