    basis。From this day on until the day you fucking die，Okay， this is the first day
    of the rest of your life。if you will，The first day where you can actually go out，Express

    hide behind a certain persona。This is the first day of you finally reconnecting
    with the real you。Not the little fake you you thought you were before this program。And
    bringing that out into the world，Sharing that value with women。And really just
    everyone around you，And the ways that this will impact your life。Once again will
    blow your mind，And I guess on a parting note here，I just say go out right now。You

    game is，You know that it''s light。you know that it''s fun，You know that it really

  text: And commit to this literally till the day you fucking die，Okay。I don't care
    if you get into a relationship，I don't care if you get married，If you have children。grandchildren，Okay，
    this doesn't even mean you have to like cheat，This is just who you are。Never lose
    touch with that，And you can express this with women，But in all areas。You can express
    this at work， through friendships，With your family，This is who you are，Okay。it's
    the same as I say in the fucking videos，Like inset in an interaction，And out of
    an interaction。There shouldn't be a difference，Wall out in a club， wall out gaming。Wall
    out during the day in fucking Starbucks gaming，Or at work with your friends at
    home。That should be the same you，Okay， still be aware of the context，But that
    should be you，So go out。Have a blast，I'm excited to hear about your upcoming experiences，About
    your epic stories。About just a life of adventure，You know， a life of being alive，
    of being free。And that's really what it's about too，Just fully fucking free，Adventure，
    expression，And just bliss。That's the way I could put it，You know， and this is
    what will just make it effortless。In the long run too，You won't need willpower，Like
    I don't need willpower to go out。If game is something that required willpower，Every
    time you went out，It just wouldn't be the game。So have a blast，Enjoy it，And excited
    to hear about your progress，And your new life。Until next time。
