    for you guys，Because I had some thoughts in my mind。And I wanted to share it with
    you，Now hopefully with Boss right now in your life。You moved from a place of fear
    and concern，Maybe leaving a little bit of anger。That you originally experienced
    when you first started the program，You know。that''s why you picked it up，And you
    want to move to a place of sort of like self-awareness，You know。so，When you first
    start a program like this，You know， the reason why you pick it up is because you。Feel
    those emotions of fear， anger， etc。，Fustration，And that''s a very low level of
    consciousness。And what I try to do through awareness，Talk about your values and
    your character and things like that。Is move you to self-awareness，That''s kind
    of like the middle level。And then once you kind of finish the program，You have
    all these experiences， these missions。It stretches you spiritually and emotionally
    in a way。Where you understand the world around you and others，And that''s like，
    you know。all encompassing kind of awareness，You understand yourself and others。So
    that''s what I''m trying to get you to，So at first if I started with the kind
    of like these。The mission we give you today，'

    is took me 10 years to do，I read thousands of articles。And literally hundreds
    of books，About 500 books courses，And programs in the area of self-development。And
    one of the common things that they always always said，Was successful CEOs or business
    people。Get up in the morning and do some form of exercise，Some form of exercise，Okay，
    whether it's like。you know， five minutes of crunches，Or a little run around the
    block or whatever。Because they understand that if they can use their willpower，Which

    their day in a little bit，In the morning。And set their day in the right path，They
    then are able to have that chain reaction。Where it sets up the rest of their day，Where

- answers: '-   处理最困难的事情可以节省意志力，因为早上头脑清醒，意志力最充足，如果能够用有限的意志力来完成重要的任务，就可以避免下午或晚上在疲劳状态下处理这些任务，从而保持高效率。

    -   意志力是有限的资源，因为我们的大脑每天需要在许多不同的方面做出决策和控制自己的行为，而每个人的意志力水平都是有限的。研究表明，随着一天的进行，意志力水平会逐渐降低，因此在一天中早些时候尽可能使用有限的意志力是最为有效的。

    -   合理利用有限的意志力可以包括将任务划分为较小的部分，制定明确的目标和计划，并在处理任务时尽可能减少干扰，同时要注意在紧急情况下优先处理最重要的事情。

    -   如果处理困难事情时耗尽了意志力，可能会出现决策疲劳、决策错误、注意力不集中等问题，导致效率和生产力下降。

    -   除了早上处理最困难的事情外，其他方法可以包括充足的休息、锻炼身体、保持良好的饮食习惯等，这些方法可以帮助提高意志力和维持高效率。'

  text: It gives them that drive to force，To knock it out of the park later on the
    day。When other challenges come up，They feel like they're in a good flow，They're
    in a good vibe。They're happy， etc。，And their mind is just tuned in，So you want
    to do that for yourself。Now there's also a great book，By Brian Tracy，Which is
    called Eat the Frog。I personally haven't read all the whole book，But I've read
    little segments，And little parts of it。And I've heard great things about it，From
    people that I trust and I respect。And in that book Eat the Frog，Brian Tracy essentially
    says，He's like well。What you want to do is the hardest thing in the morning，Because
    that takes up all of your willpower。And if you can handle the hardest thing in
    the morning，The rest of your day is good。But also if you handle the hardest thing
    in the morning first，You get it out the way。A lot of times we leave these things
    like gyms，We say oh we're going to go to the gym。After work is done，And then you
    go to work，And it drains you of all of your willpower。Because you have a limited
    amount of willpower，That's used there。Created as energy to prefrontal cortex，You
    have a limited amount，Can be strengthened like a muscle。But you have a limited
    amount，You use it all up at work，Fighting with projects etc。。And then you go to
    the gym，Try to go to the gym after work，And you can't do it。You're just like ah
    fuck this，I'm out of here，Right so the idea of it is。Do the hardest things first
    in the day，And one of the hardest things，

  text: Just to get the ball rolling。Might be doing a daily morning ritual，Well Madison
    that's fantastic。But how does it help me with pickup，How does it help me with
    the ladies，It helps you in this way。When you know，That from the beginning of the
    morning，You were on point，You were focused。You were tuned in，You were zoned in，You
    were hungry，You were a shark，When you know that。And you step up，Through that lady
    at the club，Or on the street，You know，Think about it。8 o'clock in the morning
    day game，When you're running to the bus stop at work，You see that girl。You're
    already in the fucking zone，You're already there，Because you know you've handled
    some shit。You're like yeah，It boosts your inner self confidence，Your ability to
    fall through。Your ability to trust in yourself，A long time ago I had this video
    on YouTube。I think it's still there，You can go check it out，It's on the RSD Motivation
    channel。And it's called incremental integrity，Incremental integrity，And what that
    is。Is that every time you keep，Promise to yourself，It builds up your self respect，So
    that's the idea。Now with the morning ritual，You don't want to start this off，With
    something absolutely crazy。That you're not going to keep，There's a girl I'm seeing
    right now。She says her mom is a successful CEO，And her mom says fuck goals。Her
    mom doesn't do anything like that，She goes fuck goals，It's all about habits。Fuck
    goals it's all about habits，So the idea of this is，You just want to start with
    a habit。That you can maintain，
- summary: '-   养成一个可持续的习惯，不要从一开始就做一些疯狂的事情，而是从一个小习惯开始，比如每天去健身房做一分钟跑步，换上运动服，然后离开。这比开始一个大而宏伟的计划更好。开始于一个非常小的习惯，比如早上的前五分钟，可能是一段感恩祈祷，或者回顾昨天做的事情，让自己感觉良好。重要的是养成习惯。1.

  text: And a habit that you can keep，You don't want to start with something crazy。That's
    really hard for you to do，That you're not going to keep，Just the habit，So in the
    beginning。The habit of just going to the gym，Doing one minute on the treadmill，Taking
    off your shoes。Or changing your clothes back，And leaving the gym，That's better
    than this big grandiose idea。Of you going to go to the gym，For an hour a day and
    crush it，Just start with the fucking habit。The small habit，Start with something
    very very small，The first five minutes of the morning。And that might be a gratitude
    prayer，Where you say some things，That you're thankful of in your life。Or some
    things that you've done yesterday，That really help boost up your soul。And make
    you feel good on the inside，And respect yourself，That could be something you do。I
    do that every morning，The first five minutes could just be。You know if going to
    the gym is too much，I used to literally roll out of bed。With an alarm clock of
    P。 Diddy，It was like this YouTube video I got，I put onto a CD，And it's P。Diddy
    saying like，I can do it，I believe in myself，I trust myself and God，And that's
    it。Lock in motherfucker lock in，That was my alarm clock，And I set that on my phone
    to go off。Or my CD player to go off，And I'd roll out of bed，And I'd do 20 crunches，20
    dips and 20 push ups。That's it，That was my first morning ritual，For maybe like
    a month，That was it，Or for two weeks。And then I just got the ball rolling with
    that，The idea is the habit is more important。

    gets you all pumped up and excited。And makes you feel relaxed and refreshed，Like
    you shed a skin and you're a new person。Ready to go start the day，What else let's
    think here，What else could you do。You could also maybe do a smoothie，I do that
    every morning，Very very basic smoothie。My smoothie has blueberries for antioxidants，Some
    maca powder，I have some vegetable proteins。Some vegan protein，Or some egg protein
    in there，I would think about putting B-Pol in it，But I don't。I also put some crushed
    up or frozen，Blackberries in a can or strawberries。And kind of add some flavor，I
    put some veggie greens plus powder in there，And that's about it。You know I'm pretty
    much good to go with that，That's kind of the way I start my day with that。So you
    could add a whole bunch of other things，Into your routine as well。I also do an
    audio book for 20 minutes，Some people say how do you have all this fucking time。To
    do an audio book and exercise，Well I listen to the audio book，Usually when I exercise。Or
    you could listen to the audio book，For 20 minutes on your way to work。Which it
