  text: '# 03.麦迪森BOSS【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：奖金：从你早上睁开眼睛的那一刻起就S死它（高清）- 字幕君請按讚-，Hey！ What up？，MadCy
    with Real Social Dynamics，And welcome to this week''s mission for Boss。I''m outside
    here in my little town of Toronto，A little town within Toronto。Which is a big
    city and it''s freezing fucking cold。But I decided to pop out here and do a video
    for you guys，Because I had some thoughts in my mind。And I wanted to share it with
    you，Now hopefully with Boss right now in your life。You moved from a place of fear
    and concern，Maybe leaving a little bit of anger。That you originally experienced
    when you first started the program，You know。that''s why you picked it up，And you
    want to move to a place of sort of like self-awareness，You know。so，When you first
    start a program like this，You know， the reason why you pick it up is because you。Feel
    those emotions of fear， anger， etc。，Fustration，And that''s a very low level of
    consciousness。And what I try to do through awareness，Talk about your values and
    your character and things like that。Is move you to self-awareness，That''s kind
    of like the middle level。And then once you kind of finish the program，You have
    all these experiences， these missions。It stretches you spiritually and emotionally
    in a way。Where you understand the world around you and others，And that''s like，
    you know。all encompassing kind of awareness，You understand yourself and others。So
    that''s what I''m trying to get you to，So at first if I started with the kind
    of like these。The mission we give you today，'
- summary: "-   早晨仪式对成功的CEO和商业人士至关重要，因为它有助于他们正确开始一天，激发他们的动力和意志力。\n    1.  早晨仪式可以帮助他们正确开始一天，确保一天顺利进行。\n\
    \    2.  通过早晨锻炼，他们能够利用意志力克服困难，为一天的成功奠定基础。\n    3.  早晨仪式的积极影响会带来连锁反应，让他们充满动力并取得成功。"
  text: If I gave it to you originally，You wouldn't see the reason in doing it。You
    see the purpose in doing it，The benefit in doing it either。But now since you kind
    of went through the process of，The other missions we've had。You're going to see
    the value of it，And today's mission。What I want to talk to you about is your morning
    ritual，Okay， your morning ritual，Now。what would the benefit of having a morning
    ritual，Even do for you。How does it affect your game and so on，A morning ritual
    is，The idea is it helps you get your life。Or your day started in the right way，Get
    your day started in the right track，You know。in the course of creating Boss，Which
    is took me 10 years to do，I read thousands of articles。And literally hundreds
    of books，About 500 books courses，And programs in the area of self-development。And
    one of the common things that they always always said，Was successful CEOs or business
    people。Get up in the morning and do some form of exercise，Some form of exercise，Okay，
    whether it's like。you know， five minutes of crunches，Or a little run around the
    block or whatever。Because they understand that if they can use their willpower，Which
    we don't have very much of yet。But if they can use their willpower，To conquer
    their day in a little bit，In the morning。And set their day in the right path，They
    then are able to have that chain reaction。Where it sets up the rest of their day，Where
    they're able to kill it。And crush it because they're so pumped up，From doing things
    initially the right way。
- summary: "-   早上做最困难的事情可以提高意志力，让你在一天中更有效率。\n    1.  早上处理最困难的事情可以节省意志力。\n    2. \
    \ 意志力是有限的资源，需要合理利用。\n    3.  避免在一天结束后再处理困难事情，以免意志力耗尽。"
  text: It gives them that drive to force，To knock it out of the park later on the
    day。When other challenges come up，They feel like they're in a good flow，They're
    in a good vibe。They're happy， etc。，And their mind is just tuned in，So you want
    to do that for yourself。Now there's also a great book，By Brian Tracy，Which is
    called Eat the Frog。I personally haven't read all the whole book，But I've read
    little segments，And little parts of it。And I've heard great things about it，From
    people that I trust and I respect。And in that book Eat the Frog，Brian Tracy essentially
    says，He's like well。What you want to do is the hardest thing in the morning，Because
    that takes up all of your willpower。And if you can handle the hardest thing in
    the morning，The rest of your day is good。But also if you handle the hardest thing
    in the morning first，You get it out the way。A lot of times we leave these things
    like gyms，We say oh we're going to go to the gym。After work is done，And then you
    go to work，And it drains you of all of your willpower。Because you have a limited
    amount of willpower，That's used there。Created as energy to prefrontal cortex，You
    have a limited amount，Can be strengthened like a muscle。But you have a limited
    amount，You use it all up at work，Fighting with projects etc。。And then you go to
    the gym，Try to go to the gym after work，And you can't do it。You're just like ah
    fuck this，I'm out of here，Right so the idea of it is。Do the hardest things first
    in the day，And one of the hardest things，
- summary: "-   早晨的日常仪式可以帮助提升自信和信任自己。\n    1.  保持每天的仪式可以增加自尊。\n    2.  早晨的仪式应该从一个可持续的习惯开始。\n\
    \    3.  建立习惯可以提高内在自信和信任自己。"
  text: Just to get the ball rolling。Might be doing a daily morning ritual，Well Madison
    that's fantastic。But how does it help me with pickup，How does it help me with
    the ladies，It helps you in this way。When you know，That from the beginning of the
    morning，You were on point，You were focused。You were tuned in，You were zoned in，You
    were hungry，You were a shark，When you know that。And you step up，Through that lady
    at the club，Or on the street，You know，Think about it。8 o'clock in the morning
    day game，When you're running to the bus stop at work，You see that girl。You're
    already in the fucking zone，You're already there，Because you know you've handled
    some shit。You're like yeah，It boosts your inner self confidence，Your ability to
    fall through。Your ability to trust in yourself，A long time ago I had this video
    on YouTube。I think it's still there，You can go check it out，It's on the RSD Motivation
    channel。And it's called incremental integrity，Incremental integrity，And what that
    is。Is that every time you keep，Promise to yourself，It builds up your self respect，So
    that's the idea。Now with the morning ritual，You don't want to start this off，With
    something absolutely crazy。That you're not going to keep，There's a girl I'm seeing
    right now。She says her mom is a successful CEO，And her mom says fuck goals。Her
    mom doesn't do anything like that，She goes fuck goals，It's all about habits。Fuck
    goals it's all about habits，So the idea of this is，You just want to start with
    a habit。That you can maintain，
- summary: '-   养成一个可持续的习惯，不要从一开始就做一些疯狂的事情，而是从一个小习惯开始，比如每天去健身房做一分钟跑步，换上运动服，然后离开。这比开始一个大而宏伟的计划更好。开始于一个非常小的习惯，比如早上的前五分钟，可能是一段感恩祈祷，或者回顾昨天做的事情，让自己感觉良好。重要的是养成习惯。1.
    养成小习惯，比如每天早上的前五分钟。2. 可以尝试用简单的方式激励自己，比如设定一个激励性的闹钟。3. 坚持做一些简单的运动，如仰卧起坐、深蹲和俯卧撑，让习惯变得更重要。'
  text: And a habit that you can keep，You don't want to start with something crazy。That's
    really hard for you to do，That you're not going to keep，Just the habit，So in the
    beginning。The habit of just going to the gym，Doing one minute on the treadmill，Taking
    off your shoes。Or changing your clothes back，And leaving the gym，That's better
    than this big grandiose idea。Of you going to go to the gym，For an hour a day and
    crush it，Just start with the fucking habit。The small habit，Start with something
    very very small，The first five minutes of the morning。And that might be a gratitude
    prayer，Where you say some things，That you're thankful of in your life。Or some
    things that you've done yesterday，That really help boost up your soul。And make
    you feel good on the inside，And respect yourself，That could be something you do。I
    do that every morning，The first five minutes could just be。You know if going to
    the gym is too much，I used to literally roll out of bed。With an alarm clock of
    P。 Diddy，It was like this YouTube video I got，I put onto a CD，And it's P。Diddy
    saying like，I can do it，I believe in myself，I trust myself and God，And that's
    it。Lock in motherfucker lock in，That was my alarm clock，And I set that on my phone
    to go off。Or my CD player to go off，And I'd roll out of bed，And I'd do 20 crunches，20
    dips and 20 push ups。That's it，That was my first morning ritual，For maybe like
    a month，That was it，Or for two weeks。And then I just got the ball rolling with
    that，The idea is the habit is more important。
- summary: "-   养成良好习惯后，可以增加更多锁定事项，比如晚上洗澡。也许你想早上洗澡，因为这会让你兴奋和放松，感觉焕然一新。你可以尝试做一杯简单的冰沙，加入蓝莓、马卡粉、蔬菜蛋白和其他成分。此外，你还可以在早晨听一本有声书，利用通勤时间或运动时候。初始阶段，只需进行五分钟的早晨仪式。\

  text: Once you start getting that habit down，That you can lock in more things right，If
    you shower at night。Maybe you want to do your shower in the morning，Because it
    gets you all pumped up and excited。And makes you feel relaxed and refreshed，Like
    you shed a skin and you're a new person。Ready to go start the day，What else let's
    think here，What else could you do。You could also maybe do a smoothie，I do that
    every morning，Very very basic smoothie。My smoothie has blueberries for antioxidants，Some
    maca powder，I have some vegetable proteins。Some vegan protein，Or some egg protein
    in there，I would think about putting B-Pol in it，But I don't。I also put some crushed
    up or frozen，Blackberries in a can or strawberries。And kind of add some flavor，I
    put some veggie greens plus powder in there，And that's about it。You know I'm pretty
    much good to go with that，That's kind of the way I start my day with that。So you
    could add a whole bunch of other things，Into your routine as well。I also do an
    audio book for 20 minutes，Some people say how do you have all this fucking time。To
    do an audio book and exercise，Well I listen to the audio book，Usually when I exercise。Or
    you could listen to the audio book，For 20 minutes on your way to work。Which it
    would be like popping it into your audible，Your iPhone or whatever。When you're
    in the subway or on the metro，Or the bus or whatever it is right。So you could
    think of ways to get it done，But initially what I want you to do。Is just have
    a five minute morning ritual，
