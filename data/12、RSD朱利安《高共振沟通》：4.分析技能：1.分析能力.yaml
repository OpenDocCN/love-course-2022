  text: '# 12、RSD朱利安《高共振沟通》：4.分析技能：1.分析能力Analytical skills，These come through，Unlike
    emotional skills where it''s letting go introspection。Analytical skills will come
    through reference experiences，This isn''t something that you''re born with。You
    are born with that innate charisma，You are born with no ceilings of success like
    that 80%。But the last 20% that comes through action，It''s like tap into my authenticity
    awesome。Let''s go now connect with people，That is something you must learn，How
    to talk to people。how to connect with people，How to read people， to connect with
    them better，That''s analytical skills。You can''t avoid taking action，You want
    to get good at talking to people，Go talk to a lot of people。However， you need
    to get the right references，Here are some common sticking points and problems。I''ve
    seen clients fall into over the years trying to do this。Number one is they''re
    going to go out and get a lot of references。But they keep doing the same thing
    again and again，They don''t learn from their references。And they think that the
    more they get things will magically change，No， nothing will change。There''s a
    client that comes to mind who''s like，I''ve been working for a couple years。Trying
    to meet new people say hi，And I go up and I was like hey how''s it going。And it
    comes off a little strong that and it''s like，And no one really wants to say hi。And
    I''ve been doing it again and again and again，I''m like change your approach，What
    are you doing。So references alone，No， you need the right ones，'
- answers: '-   保持在学习参考资料中学习的过程中保持自己的真实性，需要不断适应和学习，但同时保持真实性意味着要避免通过假装或改变自己来获得别人的认可。这意味着要从参考资料中学习，但不以牺牲真实自我为代价。

    -   不能仅仅因为别人喜欢你而改变自己，因为这样做会导致人们只喜欢你的假象，而不是真实的你。学习参考资料的关联在于，正确的参考应该是帮助你展现真实自我，而不是让你变得更加虚假。

    -   在展现真实自我的同时，要避免过度假装，可以通过放下对外界的期待和压力，坚持真实的表达，而不是为了迎合别人而改变自己的行为或态度。

    -   在放下成见的同时客观地看待周围的人，可以通过意识到自己的偏见，并努力理解他人的真实意图和情感。这有助于避免对他人的歪曲看法，从而实现更有效的学习和交流。

    in a way that compromises your authenticity。And we will talk about this，But you
    better be taking the data。You must also learn how to put the real you out there。If
    you're getting references where as we talked about，It's a line that's getting
    validated。Or you're being fake，You're like if I put on this front people like
    me。If I act this way people like me，Those are not good references，Those are references
    that tell you。You're only liked when you're being fake，You're only liked when
    you're putting on that front。You're not liked for you，And that actually hurts
    your overall self-esteem，More than it helps。Because although yeah it might be
    scary，Like what if I get rejected for being me。It sucks even more when you believe，And
    you create that belief within yourself。You're only accepted when you're being
    someone，That you're not，And then another big one here is。You need to first let
    go，To see people for who they are，Because otherwise。All those things that run
    you，They hijack your focus。And you will actually not see the world for what it
    is。And you will not be learning from those references，Say for example，You're very
    triggered。You're like oh I'm triggered oh like that，And you get in this very competitive
    state。You might start seeing people，As being out to get you，Being very scary。Not
    being on the same team as you，People tend to have this experience。When they walk

  text: But the emotional is the foundation，Okay。Analytical skills really，Focus on
    the connecting side of things too。You can think of it as there's authenticity，But
    then there's also relatability。The better you are at reading people，Understanding
    people，The better you will connect with them。We tend to think that it's bad，Oh
    it's kind of mean and manipulative，To learn to read people。What do you mean calibrate，It's
    like sure，If you're a terrible person，You could use that for evil。Yes，But that's
    just basic communication skills，You don't do it in a way to compromise your authenticity。You're

    with。If you're able to know them，And read them，You're able to communicate your
    true self。In a way where they'll appreciate it，And connect with it on a much deeper
    level。That's what the analytical skills are，Otherwise it just goes to waste。I've

    know how to act appropriately，In different situations。They don't know how to read
    the room，Or read the person。Opportunities just get closed off to them left and

    person，You'd actually be a good fit for that business。Oh that person would actually，It'd
    be much better if they worked with you。But because they can't be relatable，Done，OK，And
