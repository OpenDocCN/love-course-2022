  text: '# 12、RSD朱利安《高共振沟通》：4.分析技能：1.分析能力Analytical skills，These come through，Unlike
    emotional skills where it''s letting go introspection。Analytical skills will come
    through reference experiences，This isn''t something that you''re born with。You
    are born with that innate charisma，You are born with no ceilings of success like
    that 80%。But the last 20% that comes through action，It''s like tap into my authenticity
    awesome。Let''s go now connect with people，That is something you must learn，How
    to talk to people。how to connect with people，How to read people， to connect with
    them better，That''s analytical skills。You can''t avoid taking action，You want
    to get good at talking to people，Go talk to a lot of people。However， you need
    to get the right references，Here are some common sticking points and problems。I''ve
    seen clients fall into over the years trying to do this。Number one is they''re
    going to go out and get a lot of references。But they keep doing the same thing
    again and again，They don''t learn from their references。And they think that the
    more they get things will magically change，No， nothing will change。There''s a
    client that comes to mind who''s like，I''ve been working for a couple years。Trying
    to meet new people say hi，And I go up and I was like hey how''s it going。And it
    comes off a little strong that and it''s like，And no one really wants to say hi。And
    I''ve been doing it again and again and again，I''m like change your approach，What
    are you doing。So references alone，No， you need the right ones，'
- summary: "-   学习如何从参考资料中学习，但不要牺牲自己的真实性。\n    1.  不要仅仅因为别人喜欢你而改变自己。\n    2.  学会展现真实的自己，而不是假装。\n\
    \    3.  需要先放下成见，看清周围的人。"
  text: So you need to be learning from your references。Adapting from your references，Not
    in a way that compromises your authenticity。And we will talk about this，But you
    better be taking the data。You must also learn how to put the real you out there。If
    you're getting references where as we talked about，It's a line that's getting
    validated。Or you're being fake，You're like if I put on this front people like
    me。If I act this way people like me，Those are not good references，Those are references
    that tell you。You're only liked when you're being fake，You're only liked when
    you're putting on that front。You're not liked for you，And that actually hurts
    your overall self-esteem，More than it helps。Because although yeah it might be
    scary，Like what if I get rejected for being me。It sucks even more when you believe，And
    you create that belief within yourself。You're only accepted when you're being
    someone，That you're not，And then another big one here is。You need to first let
    go，To see people for who they are，Because otherwise。All those things that run
    you，They hijack your focus。And you will actually not see the world for what it
    is。And you will not be learning from those references，Say for example，You're very
    triggered。You're like oh I'm triggered oh like that，And you get in this very competitive
    state。You might start seeing people，As being out to get you，Being very scary。Not
    being on the same team as you，People tend to have this experience。When they walk
    into a new social setting，
- summary: "-   人们走进一个房间，他们会感到竞争，依赖于动力，但应该从一开始就是合作的。竞争会分散你的注意力，我们的大脑会过滤出有价值的信息。恐惧会影响你的注意力，甚至会扭曲现实。你需要看清世界的真实面貌，放下自我，学会适应现实。需要情感和分析能力。\
    \ \n    1.  竞争与合作\n    2.  注意力的过滤\n    3.  恐惧的影响\n-   适应现实\n    1.  放下自我\n   \
    \ 2.  学会适应\n    3.  情感与分析"
  text: They walk in a room and they're like。Oh it's me versus the room，Very competitive，And
    then say they rely on momentum。They go talk to a bunch of people，They're like
    oh now I'm collaborative。When in reality it should be collaborative from the start，But
    say it's very competitive。That hijacks your focus，We have this thing called your
    RAS，Reticular Activating System。Where there's just too much data to focus on in
    the world。That we're going to filter out what doesn't have value，And zone in on
    what does。Say your state of fear，That colors your focus，And that's what you're
    going to zone in on。Or even project onto people，Where you might see someone，That
    in reality is very nice。In reality is just waiting to meet someone，But your mind
    will distort reality。And say there's someone who，You know what these seem pretty
    scary，They seem pretty mean。You know how would I，What would be a good way to go
    say hi to that person。So that they like me since they're so mean，And what are
    you doing，You're not adapting to reality。You're not calibrating to reality，You're
    calibrating to that projection。To that distortion of reality，And if you truly
    believe it。You will act in ways that will actually manifest that，So to get the
    right references。You need to see the world for what it is，Letting go，You need
    to put your real。Authentic self out there，Letting go，And you need to learn from
    it。Ego aside versus repeating the same thing，Again and again and again。So you
    need both emotional and analytical，

  text: But the emotional is the foundation，Okay。Analytical skills really，Focus on
    the connecting side of things too。You can think of it as there's authenticity，But
    then there's also relatability。The better you are at reading people，Understanding
    people，The better you will connect with them。We tend to think that it's bad，Oh
    it's kind of mean and manipulative，To learn to read people。What do you mean calibrate，It's
    like sure，If you're a terrible person，You could use that for evil。Yes，But that's
    just basic communication skills，You don't do it in a way to compromise your authenticity。You're
    still being you，You're doing it，So it's a bigger win for whoever you interact
    with。If you're able to know them，And read them，You're able to communicate your
    true self。In a way where they'll appreciate it，And connect with it on a much deeper
    level。That's what the analytical skills are，Otherwise it just goes to waste。I've
    seen so many people who have great intentions，Great people。But because they don't
    know how to act appropriately，In different situations。They don't know how to read
    the room，Or read the person。Opportunities just get closed off to them left and
    right，And they don't understand why。Like you'd actually be a good fit for this
    person，You'd actually be a good fit for that business。Oh that person would actually，It'd
    be much better if they worked with you。But because they can't be relatable，Done，OK，And
    then when it comes to analytical skills too。This is very important，

  text: There is a difference between，You could say backward focused willpower。And
    forward willpower，Backward willpower，This is all through letting go。But this is
    what people do when they，Fight the guards of self-sabotage，Right，You're scared。You're
    like make yourself do it，Oh I'm in my head，I'm gonna try to get out of my head。It's
    like you're using all this willpower，Towards fighting against yourself。Forward
    willpower is really tapping into，The analytical skills。Or instead of using up
    all that willpower，Fighting against yourself，You let go。So you're moving forward，And
    then you dedicate all of it towards。The expression of you being yourself and being
    authentic，Every single person only has。X amount of willpower per day，Don't use
    it fighting against yourself，Let go，But do use it to polish。That expression of
    you，Right now in this moment，Am I using willpower，Yes，Right。If I wasn't even to
    form a word，I need to use willpower，To craft this presentation。To explain these
    concepts，I need to use willpower，But the more you start wasting on。Oh am I good
    enough，What do people think，Oh am I good enough，Oh what about this。You just won't
    have enough，So free all that up，And then use your willpower moving forward。To
    connect better，And again to dedicate it towards。These analytical skills。
