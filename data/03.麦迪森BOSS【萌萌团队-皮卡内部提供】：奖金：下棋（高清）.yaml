  text: '# 03.麦迪森BOSS【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：奖金：下棋（高清）Hey man， what''s up？，Madison here with
    Real Social Dynamics，and welcome to the Boss mission， okay？。So today we''re going
    to talk about the mission，that is for this week。，It''s very， very interesting。。We''re
    here in Prague， the beautiful city of Prague。，Actually in front of one of the
    power towers。they have here。，Apparently all the kings and monarchs，would go through
    this tower。through the village，on the way to the castle for their ceremony。，So
    I thought it would be a very。very fitting environment，to talk to you about the
    idea of chess， okay？，Chess for your game。chess for your life，and chess as this
    week''s mission。，Now， I want to talk about the reasons why。I chose chess， okay？，So
    first of all， chess is the game that you play，，board game。。There''s different
    variations of it all around the world。，But this is pretty basic， right？。Pretty
    straightforward。，Now， the reason I chose chess is because。I didn''t just think
    of it out of thin air。，As always， I put a lot of thought。into why these missions
    and what these missions mean。，I didn''t just pull this out of my ass， okay？。So
    the reason I chose chess is this。，I did a lot， a lot， a lot， a lot of research。，A
    ton of research。，A shit ton of research as usual。，And what did I find out？，In
    that research， I found out that。every single successful entrepreneur， CEO，of the
    largest companies， at one point or another，。devoted their time to learning chess，
    okay？，It''s a very articulable skill，and it has many。'
- summary: "-   下棋有很多好处，其中之一是教会你延迟满足感。现在，你可以想象自己，你知道，你会说你出去玩，你去夜店，你正在学习与陌生人交谈，你面前有这些女孩，你可能认为你应该等待亲吻，但出于某种原因，砰，你必须立刻行动。你甚至不能等到回家再采取行动。现在，我不是说你应该总是在夜店外亲吻。有时候你应该在里面亲吻。这取决于情况。但假设在那个特定的时刻，你知道你应该等待。这就是所谓的延迟满足感。如果你有钱，但不想花，想要存起来，或者由于某种原因，每次走出家门，钱都在你口袋里烧个洞，你就花了，那就是糟糕的延迟满足感。下棋就是教会你延迟满足感的事物之一。它还教会你技能，教会你战略技能。你可能听说过《孙子兵法》这本书，非常经典，它说要了解你的地形，了解人们，了解你是否会赢得战争。因此，你不只是试图攻击眼前的东西，你要考虑长期战略。\
    \  \n    1.  下棋教会你延迟满足感，让你学会等待合适的时机。\n    2.  下棋教会你技能和战略，让你不只是看到眼前的局势，还要考虑长期发展。\n\
    \    3.  延迟满足感在生活中的应用，如理财和决策制定。"
  text: many benefits。，One of the first benefits is，chess teaches you delayed gratification。，Now。you
    can imagine yourself， you know，，you'll say you go out to the field，，you go out
    to a nightclub，。you're learning to talk to strangers，，and you have these girls
    in front of you，。and you maybe think you should wait for the kiss，，but for some
    reason， bam，。you just have to go for it right at that moment。，You can't even wait
    until you get home。to maybe make that move，or whatever the move is， right？，Now，
    I'm not saying you should kiss。always outside the nightclub。，Sometimes you should
    kiss inside of it。，It varies。，You know。depending on situation。，But let's say in
    that particular moment，，you knew you should have waited。。That is called delayed
    gratification。，If you have money，and you don't want to spend it，。you want to save
    it，，or for some reason， every time，you walk out the house，。the money burns a hole
    in your pocket，and you spend it，，that is bad delayed gratification。。So chess is
    one of these things，that teach you delayed gratification。。What it also does is
    teaches you skill， okay？，Teaches you skill。。I'm getting bumped by Asian tourists，as
    I'm kind of walking through here。。Teaches you the skill of strategy。，Now， you
    might have heard that book，，The Art of War，，very。very classic book，，which says
    know your terrain，to understand people，。to understand if you're going to win，the
    war or not。，So you're not just trying to。attack what's in front of you。，You're
    trying to think long-term strategy。

  text: and what does that look like。，For example， right？，For example，，while you're
    doing pickup， again，。or while you're pursuing a career in life，or a promotion
    in your career，。you're going to be thinking about，what is my end goal here？，What
    is the quote， unquote big game？。What is the larger picture，that I'm trying to
    go after？，And how does that affect me？。How does that affect what I'm doing right
    now，in this very moment，versus what I want to do。long-term in the future？，So you
    got to think big picture。，What is the terrain？。Get to know your terrain。，Get to
    know people。，Get to know their habits。。Get to know their thought patterns。，So
    chess is going to teach you all that。。It's going to teach you people，，their habits，，and
    their thought patterns， right？。You're going to look at who you're playing with，and
    you're going to think to yourself。as we turn around here，，you're going to look
    at who you're playing with。and you're going to think to yourself，，actually let's
    go that way， yeah。。We're looking at who you're playing with。，You're going to think
    to yourself，。is this a person that has short temper？，Is this a person that has
    a long reaction time？。Is this a rational person？，So you're going to look at not
    just yourself，。but you're going to use your awareness skills，that you've been
    developing so far。to understand who you're playing against，，who you're interacting
    with。。Because success isn't just yourself，，it's also who you're interacting with，
    correct？，Now。one other thing，
- summary: "-   Managing your emotions is crucial for expressing inner game and finding\
    \ opportunities.\n    1.  Chess provides a platform to balance rational and irrational\
    \ thoughts.\n    2.  It teaches you to trust yourself and make the right moves\
    \ under pressure.\n    3.  Adversity in chess mirrors real-life challenges and\
    \ the importance of strategic thinking."
  text: that it's also going to help you out with，is going to also be this idea。of
    management of your own emotions。，A lot of guys said，，Madison， yo， I picked a boss。。It's
    fucking sick。，Now what do I do with it？，How do I find opportunities。for you to
    express this inner game，that I'm having？，And managing your emotions。is definitely
    one of these things，that allow you to do that， right？，But what's the opportunity？。Chess。，You're
    going to say， hey，，you have a moment where your rational brain。comes out with
    your irrational brain。，They're head to head。，And you're going to say，。do I want
    to battle it out，and make the wrong move now？，Or are my emotions more calm and
    relaxed。and I trusted myself in the process，and then make the right move later
    on？，Okay？。It's one of these things，that are just priceless。，Kings， queens， monarchs。have
    been doing it for centuries。，It's really just amazing。，It'll change your results
    of everything。。It allows you to access，kind of like almost like another dimension
    of thought。。It allows you to be able to say，，hey， myself as a person，，I'm not
    perfect。。I'm going to work in progress，，but I'm going to do the best that I can
    right now。。Chess also teaches you，to think about moments of adversity， right？，So
    those are moments where。you might lose one of your major chess pieces，and you
    got to struggle。，You got to hustle to survive。。Now do you get into a defensive
    mode，and just try to hang on？。Or are you still going to try to stalemate，and，
    you know， get that king。

  text: and corner him so he can't move？，Even though you're at a weakness， a deficit。。So
    it's ultimately the game of life。，You know， when you think about doing。any kind
    of pick up or self-development，，you don't really want to be thinking about。the
    idea of checkers。，Life is not about checkers。，Not like one shot， one kill，，one
    shot， one kill。one move， one kill。，That's not the idea of life。，It's not checkers，
    okay？，Life is chess。。It is chess。，It's a long-term game strategy。，You're going

    look at the big picture。all right？，So your mission for this week，is I want you
    to engage in one or two，，if you can。and this is really hard sometimes，，one or
    two chess sessions。，I say it might be hard because。sometimes it's hard to find
    a person，that could actually play with you， right？。So you'd have to do it online。，I
    prefer you do it in person rather than online。because in person gives you，like
    a different type of effect。，In person gives you the ability。to look at the person
    in your eyes，you're playing with and have that relation。that back and forth relation，
    right？，So I prefer you do it in person。，Now we can stop here as well。。When you
    do it in person，，it's going to allow you to have that human connection。that this
    is all about。，You want to learn about that stuff。，Now one or two chess sessions。。If
    you've never played chess before，，
