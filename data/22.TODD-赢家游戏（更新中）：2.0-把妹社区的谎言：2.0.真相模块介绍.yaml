    videos speak for themselves and are setup well。But there are a couple quick points
    I wanna make，In the link up to the launch on this course。There are lot of controversy，Lot
    of anticipation about this section in the most part。People say shoot fire and
    that sort of thing，I wanna make the point。That this section is not about people，It
    about ideas，If I am saying this idea is kinda BS。我不是說這個人說了這個想法，因為很多時候是很多人說的，可能是幾百個或是幾百個人說了這些想法，很多這些想法甚至不是原始的作品，是你認為的那些人，或是你跟他們合作的那些人，所以我不是在攻擊那些人。我只是在攻擊這個想法，和這個想法的負面負面影響，另外因為有人有一個壞想法，也不會讓他們變成壞人，也不會讓其他想法變成壞人，所以不要認為這是一個個人攻擊，這真的是我看到這些不公平的事。我看到他們傷害學生的學生，我希望能夠讓他們，從這個遊戲的道理中，讓他們能夠進一步，所以我想讓你們明白這個部分，這是什麼意思和不是什麼意思，即使有時候我用了一個人的詞語，這只是因為這就是我熟悉的詞語。這並不是說這個人的詞語，是用了另一個詞語，並不是用了另一個詞語，所以再次，想想想，不只是人類，想想如何可以幫助你學習，不只是想像這個人，作為一些攻擊，或是一些建立一個人，或者是一個教師，或者其他東西。在一個直接的方式，所以我只是想要讓這個清楚，因為這些是不公平的想法，而這就是一些人可能會誤會的，所以我再
    большое確保оч這個部分。'
