    from his looks，his money， his status，You know， it''s like， oh。how good looking
    am I？，Do I look really good？ Am I very well groomed？，How much looks do I have？。How
    much money do I have？，How much status do I have？，And tries to go about it that
    way，Okay。now this here does not work，It''s also unsustainable，And， you know。when

    answer is no，And that there， that little subtlety。that you version of hey， how''s
    it going？，Which you can''t really put into words，or logically explain。That is

    it also applies to different subtleties，Within the interaction，For example， you
    know。you may hear，Offering value， taking value，And we think very， you know， surface
    layer，Well。offering value is， you know， sharing a story，Taking value is asking
    a question，But that's wrong。okay？，That's the doing，It's about the place it's coming
    from，Everything that matters in game。It's all about the place it's coming from，So
    understand this。You can offer value while asking a question，Okay， here's the difference，Here's
    asking a question。taking value，Hey， do you know where， you know，This the train
    station is。Do you know where the train station is，You're taking in the vibe，Hey。do
    you know where the train station is，You're offering in the vibe，Those are the
    little subtleties。And this is the reason a lot of guys，Just don't succeed with
    women，You understand the doing。It's logical， you're like， well， if you say this，This
    is the line， this is the action。This is the doing，But the being is the stuff，That

  text: Is I focused on quality of content。Not quantity of content，Okay， because once
    you're in this doing paradigm。It's very easy to compensate for，You know， your
    lack of success，Rationalizing， you know。It's just that I'm not doing enough，So
    you compensate by doing more and more and more。And you may be caught in this here，Where
    you're like， well， if the girl doesn't like me。It's because I'm not doing enough，What
    are some other things I need to do，To get the girl。Not realizing that it's not
    about， you know，The things you do。It's all about the place they come from，You
    know， and then from there。You could do more if you want to，But you don't have
    to，And until you get to the cause。Until you get to the being，The doing will always
    suffer，Okay， and this is why maybe right now。You know， you may feel a little bit
    frustrated，You're going out and you're like。How much more things do I need to
    do，It's like I'm going out，And I'm doing this right。I'm doing this right，I'm doing

    working on the effects，Okay。if you're someone who's coming from，A taking value
    frame of mind，It doesn't matter what you do。You got to fix that，Okay， it's not

    do，To compensate for this，That's not going to help。You got to get to the source，Get
    to the cause，Get to the being，So the way I designed。The content section here，Is

    are the key concepts，That really cover all of the little details，Okay。when I go
    out，I'm not even thinking about all this content，Why？ Because I don't want to

    confusing。Maybe different paradoxes，All of that will finally click，And you will
    finally have a direction。And just a knowing，Because that's game，It's a fucking，
    like a knowing。Like you'll now know what it is，It's not logical understanding，It's
    not guessing，It's you will know。okay，So enjoy the experience that is 10 game，Your
    first time through， okay。Like this video's gonna end here in a little，Like a minute
    maybe，When you jump to the next video。Just go through it the first time，Without
    even taking notes，That'd be my advice to you。Like actually just enjoy it，You know，
    too often do we jump on the product，Or like， okay。analyze every detail，Have my
    notes ready，Writing down every little fucking line，It's like no。Simply enjoy it，Go
    through it，Have fun， watch the infield，Just notice the internal changes happen。Notice
    how your focus starts shifting，On what really matters，Notice the being，Notice
    the fun，Okay。notice every single video，Just how light and fun it is，Go through
    the exercises， have a blast。And then on your second time through，Take down notes，And
    remember that every time you go out though。Just focus on those 10 things，Those
    10 laws，
