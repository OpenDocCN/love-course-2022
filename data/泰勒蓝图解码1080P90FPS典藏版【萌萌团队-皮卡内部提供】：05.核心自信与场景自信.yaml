    他們的自然性被你影響，2。 他們對自己的反應有什麼感覺，3。 他們的焦點對你更有影響，4。他們對你對自己的反應有很大的感受，這很重要，你對自己的反應有很大的影響，你對自己的反應有很大的影響，這兩個是兩種大小，1。
    他們感受到，他們感受到有很大的反應，因為他們的自然性。你們知道當你對女性有很大的影響，當她對你做了很大的反應，你會感受到很奇怪的感覺，當她在反應時，她會感受到，另一種，這是另一個大小，她在分析自己的時間和空間，當某個人在反應時。你會覺得這就是反應時的時間嗎，假設女性真的反應了，你會覺得我應該叫她嗎？，我不知道，她會喜歡我嗎？，這是在反應時的時間和空間，你們知道高級人士在升降機，可能會有更多的空間，跟其他人相比。可能在電影院會有空間，如果你覺得另一個人有更多的空間，你會太緊張了，把空間放在空間上，因為你會覺得，我沒有要做這個，這是反應時的時機，某個人在反應時，會反應得更多，其他人會反應得更多，女性是有趣的。為什麼呢？，當女性真的被吸引，當她真的變得不舒服，當她在乎你，她會開始追求你，把空間和時間都放在你身上，像瘋子一樣，但如果她喜歡你，回家後，可能會開始思考，或許不是，但這會影響男性，女性看到男性反應。會擔心空間和時間的問題，這會很嚴重，當你打算打電話給某人，你會問，這不是正確的時間嗎？，我用了空間和時間嗎？，可能你會覺得，自己沒有這麼高的價值，另外，你可能會找到一位朋友，如果需要指導，你會打電話。但你可能不會打電話，因為打電話是一件很重要的事，有時候，這根據朋友關係，你可能會找到一位朋友，但如果是很親密的朋友，你可能會找到一位朋友，但這也沒問題，但有些關係，你會害怕去做，因為你會害怕失去關係。如果是快的，關於貴賓，可能會找到一位朋友，早上的朋友，沒有貴賓，高價值贏了所有人，開玩笑，當然，對，個人貴賓，我總是，我總是想讓人們，感覺好，不想碰到人，這就是我的貴賓，但我告訴你，如果我早上。要打電話給朋友，我會擔心，他們不喜歡我嗎，不會，我不會擔心，我不會因為，我會覺得自己很老套，我會擔心我自己，好

- answers: '-   The perceived drawbacks of giving away power to others according to
    the provided summary include losing one''s naturalness and influence over oneself,
    shifting focus towards the other person''s reactions, and feeling a sense of unease
    when analyzing one''s own time and space in relation to the other person.

    -   Core confidence is highlighted as crucial in social interactions because it
    allows individuals to retain their power and not give it away to others. This
    means not reacting excessively or nervously to others, maintaining one''s own
    sense of self-worth, and not seeking validation or approval from others.

    -   The preferences of women regarding men''s behavior relate to the concept of
    giving away power in that women do not want men to be nervous or overly attentive
    to them. They prefer men who are confident and do not hand over their power, as
    this indicates a lack of self-assurance and can be unattractive.

    -   The advice given regarding socializing with popular individuals in the summary
    is to not give away your power to them. Rather than being nervous or seeking their
    approval, it is important to maintain your own sense of self and not change your
    behavior or interests to please them.

    -   True friends factor into the discussion of maintaining one''s power and confidence
    by being supportive and not requiring the individual to give away their power
    or change themselves. True friends appreciate and value you as you are, rather
    than expecting you to conform to their expectations.'

    -   情境自信是指在特定情境之下，个体拥有更高的自信和控制能力。例如，在一个人熟悉的场合中，他会表现得更为自信和吸引力，因为他知道如何适应和掌握情境中的规则和力量关系。这种自信可以通过言谈、行为、姿态等方式展现出来，影响人们对于个体的感受和行动，例如在丹尼的例子中，他作为店长时拥有的权力和信仰使得他吸引了很多女性员工的注意和顺从。

    -   在派对中，丹尼可能会感到不舒服是因为他在这个情境中没有自信和控制力，即所谓的核心自信。他没有社交圈子和权力，也没有情境自信所带来的控制感和吸引力。这将导致他在派对中表现不佳，缺乏自信和表现力。

    know？I say forget all that stuff， okay？I say let's evolve past that。Let's not
    worry about any form of personality shell or situational based confidence。Let's
    find confidence from the core。Let's find confidence from the value that you offer
    as a human being。，And look， this isn't some feel good shit， all right？I would
    hope it feels good and I would hope it's uplifting， but you want to know something？The
    guys that have this down are getting laid more and buy hotter girls and have better
    girlfriends than the guys that don't。Straight up， you know？，So on one level it's
    like uplifting and heartwarming and all that stuff。but on another level it's just
    fucking potent。It's just badass， you know？Having core confidence is just a badass
    thing to have。And that's why I want you guys to be able to develop that。Rather
    than developing a prison。develop freedom for yourself and develop authenticity。，All
    right， so look。we're gonna wrap up today on an interesting topic。Like I said，
    today we're laying down a foundation。all right？Wax on， wax off。What that means

    community， we generally shy away from that。right？We don''t really talk about that。It''s
    funny， because we come into this。And one of the major reasons that most people
    are in this room is that at one point we felt as though we''re in love。fell in

    one particular girl，learn to be successful with women in general。What does that
    mean？It means you get out of that model of the world where every girl that you
    meet that you like。you''re falling in love with。Is that interesting？So we get
    away from that。In a lot of ways。one of the reasons why this community can at times

    that are mixed in。And it's like you want to still feel those emotions。You want
    to still feel that。But there's like this like， it's almost like you're like going
    into like your love program， like， oh。oh， oh， oh， oh， she's so lovely， oh， oh，
    oh， oh， you know？Because then you remember。And you want it back， right？，You want
    those feelings to come back。You're not thinking， oh， you know。I need to disconnect

  text: She sees you as the cool，non-outcome dependent，non-reaction seeking。not attached
    to any kind of result，you're attractive。And so she has one type of personality
    towards you。And that's the personality that you're getting to know。That's the
    personality that you know。You're getting to know her，I'm with a hot guy personality。But
    then what happens is as you're being nice to her and then you start to feel those
    good emotions。you feel attached。Because you're like，we're on the same team now，we're
    on the same team。。And then suddenly what happens is you start to choke yourself
    out，right？Because you become attached to the outcome。Now she says she has to go
    to the bathroom and that same fucking cool guy that was all like。yeah，yeah，you
    know，like when you first met。Now all of a sudden it's like，oh，she coming back，oh。she
    coming back。And you're feeling that loss。You're feeling like that，those chemicals
    in your body。like where is she？And you're going，where is she，where is she at，right？Because
    you want her。Then you see her，maybe as she comes out of the bathroom，she starts
    talking to some other guy，right？Do you man up and go in there and yank her out？No，of
    course not。You're， the chemicals in your body。you can feel that kind of like that。You
    feel yourself being deflated。You can feel yourself losing state，all right？We're
    going to talk。state is going to be a huge theme of tomorrow。You feel yourself
    falling out of state。losing your mojo，you know，losing the nimbus is dimming as
    they would call it，

  text: all right？We'll talk more about that later，don't worry about it。So look。what
    happens is your concept of what love is and wanting to fall in love is actually
    interfering with the process of make。of finding that great girl。Because the truth
    is she may like you when you're acting attractive，。but as soon as you stop acting
    that way and you become outcome dependent。it's now a new sort of thing。What does
    that mean？Does that mean never fall in love？Of course not。But what that means
    is this，you're a man of standards。You have to be a man of standards。And you can
    be getting to know a girl and you can have incredible，you know。connection with
    her and feel good and enjoy it。But you remember how I talked about paradoxical
    things like on one level you know what people are like and another level you enjoy
    them and think the best？The same concept applies here。You can feel good，you can
    bath and bathe in the emotions and bask in them and enjoy them。But at the same
    time，you can't， be losing state as you start to，you know。if the attraction starts
    to flicker out。And I see this is a huge sticking point。I see this is a huge sticking
    point between guys and reaching a mastery type of level，okay？Like on an advanced
    level here。Where what happens is they're very good in the field。but when they
    start to get in with the girl，they become outcome dependent about halfway through
    the interaction because they're feeling those emotions。And they wind up losing
    the girl。And believe me，

  text: that's a painful way to lose a girl。Sucks。So how do we move past this？You
    know what I'm saying？How do we move， past that kind of a mindset。that kind of
    approach，that kind of way of coming out，this sort of thing？Again。you have to know
    that you do not know somebody until you know them。Don't make judgments。Don't make
    assumptions。Don't assume anything about the girl。Look。this girl might be seeing
    five different guys and she's going to continue seeing them even when she's with
    you。Even though she's telling you she loves you and you've got the biggest cock
    ever and whatever she's telling you。okay？It doesn't really matter。She could be
    seeing other guys。She might have countless orbiters that are driving her around。。And
    stuff like that and doing favors for her and every so often she does a favor for
    them back。All right？You don't know what the girl is like，right？She might be a
    liar。She might be deceitful。She might be needy。Have you ever thought of that one？You
    guys might think，see。any of you guys are coming from a position of scarcity，I
    know what you're thinking。You want a needy girlfriend。That's what you want。From
    scarcity，I said。If you're coming from a position of scarcity，you want the needy
    girlfriend。You're like。I want the girl that's calling me。I want the girl that
    can't get enough of me。But when you start coming from an abundance position，you
    get what the reaction is like。。The reaction that you just heard here，which is，blah，blah，right？

  text: You can't even get it to work when the girl is needy。Anyone ever had that
    experience？Like you're dating a cute girl and then she gets needy and no worky，no
    worky worky anymore。Right？Done。Just get away。Blah，gross，ugh，right？I don't know
    if maybe that's just like when you've moved past neediness yourself。it almost
    becomes your shadow。Like you。Yeah，yeah，yeah，you start being the flag，right？But
    like the thing is，you're not， the only thing is like when you work so hard not
    to become needy and then you see that behavior。in a lot of ways it can mess with
    your head because you're like，that's the old me，ugh，right？You can feel that way。In
    a certain way，I also think that you，you know，being in a relationship。you do have
    to tolerate a level of neediness from the girl because，you know。when a girl really
    likes you，she is going to just act on her emotions and that can be a sticking
    point too。But point being，look，you don't know the girl，alright？So assume nothing。Enjoy
    the experience。Enjoy the emotions but don't be attached。Do you guys understand
    what enjoyment。without attachment means？Enjoy the experience fully。to the fullest
    extent but don't have any attachment because believe me。that same girl that was
    one way，as soon as she sees that you're attached to the outcome。will transform
    right before your very eyes to a different person，alright？The outcome。like I want
    to be with this girl now，we're going to be together，blah，blah，okay？

  text: And I think being attached to the outcome of sex can be a negative thing。I
    also think being attached to how， having a relationship after sex can be a negative
    thing。I think being attached to just getting the extraction of the phone number
    during the first club meeting or whatever can be tough。Again，paradoxical views。On
    one side，we have like，you know，like as Ozzy would say，close，man。just close，right？You
    know，go fucking close。No，I need some report。No，close，right？On the other side。we
    have the，you know，non-outcome dependence and it's two paradoxical concepts。You
    have to have a good handle on both of them。Anyway，，I mean。I guess the way that
    I would wrap it up is like this。Love is something that you experience within yourself，alright？It's
    something that you experience when you're walking down the street。It's something
    that you experience when you're talking to a friend。It's something that you experience
    when you look at the sky。I swear to God，man。And this is kind of a funny thing。I
    think people honestly，I think。think I might be kidding when I say this，but to
    become a really，really good at picking up chicks。like this is kind of funny，to
    be amazing at picking up chicks，，you've got to get that。almost like that spiritual
    side of yourself handled，alright？And that sounds kind of funny，right？Like to mack
    the hose，okay？You know，you've got to get that，like。you've got to get almost like
    your relationship with God handled，you know what I'm saying，right？And when I say
    that，by the way，

  text: that doesn't necessarily even mean any type of religion or anything like that。but
    when I say that，I almost mean like your place in the world，right？Even as an atheist，right？Like。whatever

    about the world，like，that the world is a good place。that the world is a place
    where you're at home，a world is a place that's beautiful，you know？And when you
    can experience that，you become a person who is independently happy。and independently

    paradox of it，suddenly when you have，you know，that good feeling within yourself。and
    you don't even need a relationship anymore，you're， not even thinking about a relationship。in
    fact，a relationship has hit a point where it's kind of a stretch for you，like，uh。do
    I want to do this right now？I'm so fulfilled in my life，this is a stretch，and
    suddenly。the girls that you meet，now they want to be your girlfriend。now you've
    got the girls popping up behind fire hydrants and jumping out of hedges trying
    to be your girlfriend。right？Because you have，this is the paradox，yeah，it's the
    ultimate paradox，the，you know。what do they say，the hungry don't get fed or something
    like that？And so basically。you want to achieve that self-affirmation，，and isn't
