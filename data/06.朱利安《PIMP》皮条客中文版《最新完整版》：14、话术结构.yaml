  text: '# 06.朱利安《PIMP》皮条客中文版《最新完整版》：14、话术结构現在我們談到的很多事情都在現在上，因為有很多資訊，而且這可以讓人很擔心，當你跟女生交流的時候，假設你跟一個女生聊天，你會說
    天啊，我現在在發抖嗎，現在是否是時候去決定邏輯，我應該要申請她。我應該要做她的追求，我還要過了關嗎，我應該要設定節奏，天啊天啊天啊天啊，然後你會很驚訝，所以在這方面，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好。我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好。我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好。我們要做到最好，我們要做到最好，OK，
    and this is what I''m gonna share with you here。and by really internalizing this
    structure，it''s going to free up a lot of mental ram，OK。because when guys go out，it''s
    very common that they just obsess about the whole，what do I say。what do I say，
    what are the verbals here，oh my god， and that just stifles them，so。by taking on
    this structure as training wheels，it''ll allow you to just focus on the vibe。focus
    on the subcommunications，and not have that worry in the back of your head。so the
    first thing I''m gonna ask you to do，is write down these five lines，OK。so pull
    out a pen and paper，or open a little text file on your computer。now I know this
    can be annoying，you know， whenever I watch like self-help videos，where it''s like。you
    know what，write down like these ten goals and stuff，like， it''s very easy to be
    lazy about it。and just be like， you know what，I''m just gonna think up the ten
    goals，I''m good。but in this case here，you know， just bear with me and write these
    down，so the first one is，hey， I''m。。。，hey， I''m Julian，hey， I''m。。。，you know，'

    five little lines，like hey。I'm Julian，are you from LA，what's your name，what do
    you do，who are you here with，OK， fucking boring。now what I say to that is wrong，OK，
    if you think，interview mode questions are boring。you're just looking at the，surface
    layer of things，you know， it's like well。the content is pretty boring，I personally
    love interview mode questions，OK。I use them all throughout，my interactions，why，because
    they're so simple，OK。and because they're so simple，and just usually very short，like
    where are you from，what's your name。what do you do，OK， who are you here with，you
    can sub communicate，OK。in the deeper layer of the interaction，something much more
    powerful，than if it were a long。complicated， crazy，or you know， interesting on，the
    surface layer type of sentence，OK。so in my interactions，I always try to ground
    what I'm saying，in these interview mode questions，OK。so when you look at the five
    lines that you wrote，those are now your pillars，OK。this is the foundation of the
    conversation，and every girl that you're going to go up to，OK。when practicing this
    structure，

    Julian， are you from LA，what's your name，what do you do，who are you here with，by
    doing this，OK。you are setting the rhythm，OK， remember you're just doing，what you're
    going to do。you're not calibrating before，you're not waiting for her to take the
    lead。you're like bang bang bang bang bang，I'm at the cause，you're at the effect，react
    to me。I'm cutting the threads，I am leading，I'm putting myself in a position of
    authority。I'm just going to do whatever the fuck，I'm going to do，OK， so those
    are the five questions。now when I talk about，subcommunicating something much more
    powerful。I'm basically going to be focusing on，three separate things，OK。you're
    going to want to write these down as well，the first subcommunication，is add to
    the fun，OK。adding to the fun，number two， challenging，number three， commanding，adding
    to the fun， challenging。commanding，these are the three main subcommunications，these
    are the three main emotions。that I'm going to you know bounce around，in order
    to get the girl attracted。you know to tingle with what she's feeling ultimately。so
    if we take these three you know subcommunications，you can basically apply them
    to。all of the questions，OK， any interview mode question，say you're like you know
    what，what's your name。

  text: say you want to say that in a way，where it's adding to the fun，you can go
    up to a girl and be like。hey， what's your name，oh cool， what's your name，OK， what's
    your name，now it's still purposeful，OK。you're still you know breaking rapport，like
    what's your name，but it's like there's some fun behind。like there's a little smile，it's
    positively dominant，you know like hey， what's your name，oh really。that's fucking
    awesome，cool， what's your name，OK， adding to the fun，number two， challenging，OK。so
    you want to say what's your name，in a challenging type of way，you might go up
    and be like hmm。what's your name，you know kind of like examining，you know curiosity，it
    might be like huh， really。what's your name，a little bit more of like a push，you're
    like hmm，what's your name。is your name Julie，what's your name，OK， something along
    that vibe there，the third one is commanding。that's when you walk up to a girl，you're
    like you know what，what's your name，OK， remember ordering。OK， what's your name，bossing
    the girl around，it's like oh， that's really awesome，what's your name。adding to
    the fun， challenging， commanding，OK， now if we link these three。subcommunications
    to the five lines，that we wrote down，which one would you associate to which line。basically
    the ones that I would personally choose，is if I go up to a girl。I'm gonna be adding
    to the fun at first，OK， it's like oh hey what's up，I'm Julian，OK。so adding to
    the fun would go with，hey， I'm dot dot dot，now the second question is。

  text: are you from dot dot dot，and that one there I'd usually，you know do a little
    push。trying to reach the sexual hook point，where I'd say it in a more challenging
    type of way，OK。so you'd be like oh hey what's up，I'm Julian，are you from LA，are
    you from LA，OK。then to mix things up，what's your name，I'll do it in a commanding
    way，Oh cool， what's your name。then I'll bounce back to a more challenging type
    of vibe，where it's like，Oh cool， what do you do。and then to you know rotate between
    the three，the last one， who are you here with。I'd say it where I'm adding to the
    fun，you're like oh it's awesome， who are you here with，OK。and this is what it
    would look like，Hey what's up， I'm Julian，are you from LA，Oh cool。what's your
    name，Awesome， what do you do，Oh really， who are you here with，as simple as that。and
    really keep in mind，just how more efficient it is，to sub communicate those three
    things。you know the adding to the fun，challenging， commanding。with those bold
    short interview mode questions，OK， like how would you have the same effect。with
    a long sentence，OK， it's like sure，the long sentence might have more content。it
    might be a little bit more interesting，on a superficial level，but it won't have
    that same effect。OK， it won't hit her as hard，then say where are you from，OK，
    where are you from，Aw cool。where are you from，Where are you from，Just a lot more
    fucking powerful，OK。so these short bold questions，or lines are what grounds my
    interactions。And the ones that we just wrote down here，

  text: are just as an example，OK， like with time。come up with your own，you don't
    need to be like，OK， first it's hey I'm dot dot dot。then it's oh are you from dot
    dot dot，OK， like practice with these at first。but then come up with your own，OK，
    it can be any fucking question。And this is the beauty of this structure here，It's
    that ultimately it's impossible。to run out of interview mode questions，It's just
    impossible，There's always another question to ask。You know， if you're like hey
    what's up，So what do you do，She's like oh I'm a nurse，Awesome。what do you like
    about nursing，Oh you know it's just like a job，where you can like help people。Oh
    really， so you like helping people，Yeah， you know I really like helping people。You
    know it always makes me feel better，Really， what makes you feel better about it，I
    don't know。it just feels like，I'm very fulfilled at the end of the day，Oh cool。do
    you think I would like helping people，I guess so， I mean who wouldn't like helping
    people。I guess you're right，So where do you work，Oh I work at this hospital over
    there，OK。so on and so forth，Now on the surface it's pretty fucking boring。But
    if you're sub-communicating those three things，You know you make it a little bit
    more fun。A little bit more challenging，A little bit more commanding。Suddenly the
    interaction has a whole different meaning，OK， so ask interview mode questions。Now
    in doing so there are two ways of asking the question，The first one is asking
    her about herself。OK like oh how old are you，
- summary: "-   与女性交谈时，可以通过询问她自己或询问她对你的看法来保持对话活跃。\n    1.  询问她关于自己的问题，如年龄或职业偏好。\n\
    \    2.  在两种方式之间切换，以避免对话变得像审讯。\n    3.  在回答后灵活应对，尝试逗乐或开玩笑，保持对话有趣。"
  text: You know just ask her about herself。And the second way is asking her about
    yourself，You know like oh how old do you think I am。OK oh do you think I would
    like being a nurse，OK and you can kind of。Bounce between the two different ways，OK
    but it's impossible to run out of questions to ask。Now to mix things up，OK because
    if you just go up，And you're like oh cool what's your name。And you just stack
    these，As we previously covered，It becomes a little bit more of like an interrogation。And
    it's a lot of pressure on，OK when I'm walking up to a girl，I'm like what's your
    name。Da da da da da da da，That's putting the fucking pressure on，And you have
    to balance the two。So I'm gonna go up，And I'm gonna go through these questions，And
    in between。I'm going to improvise off whatever answer she gives me，OK so if I
    go up I'm like hey what's up。I'm Julian，Are you from LA，She might be like oh yeah。Oh
    cool you know I love LA blah blah blah blah blah，And then I'll basically improvise
    in a way。Where I'm trying to amuse myself，You know I might make it awkward，I might
    try to joke around a bit。Say whatever fucking comes to mind，And as soon as I run
    out of things to say。Or say you know she adds on，And then I add on a bit more，And
    then it just kind of dies。I'm off to the next interview mode question，OK off to
    the next bold sub communication。So it's like oh hey what's up，I'm Julian，Are you
    from LA，Oh really that's awesome I love LA。You know it's like，The place actually
    recorded this fucking product，
- summary: "-   交流技巧：在对话中，通过提问和即兴创作来保持流畅性和吸引力。\n    1.  通过提问对方和自己来保持对话的活跃性。\n    2.\

  text: What's your name。Oh your name is Julie，Oh you know that my name is actually
    Julian，Duh duh duh duh duh。Cool what do you do，OK and then you just keep on flowing
    that way。Now the beauty of this is first of all，You have the nice boom pressure
    on pressure off。OK in terms of like the bold interview mode questions，And like
    the fluff where you're improvising。And you never run out of things to say，Why，Because
    the girl is the one providing you with the topics。OK you're just asking these
    interview mode questions。And she's giving you the answers upon which you can。Improvise
    upon which you can just create something out of nothing。Now to spice things up
    a little bit more，OK right now we have the nice skeleton，OK if you take a。You
    know like an arrow is the timeline of the interaction，You have all of your。You
    know interview mode questions，Like the five lines you've you know written down。Those
    are like the pillars，In between there's the fluff where you improvise。It's like
    pressure on pressure off，Pressure on pressure off，When asking the interview mode
    questions。You do it by asking her about herself，Asking her about yourself。And
    to spice things up when improvising，You know in between the questions。You're gonna
    want to add some push pull，OK you want to make it a little bit more challenging。Not
    just always going with the fluff，OK or like just going with the flow of things。So
    what I usually tend to do，Is 80% of the time，I'm gonna do a pull，OK where basically。I
    go along with what she says，
- summary: "-   人际互动中，80%时间应该是吸引，20%时间是挑战，以保持吸引力和新鲜感。\n    1.  保持对话中的吸引力和挑战性，增加不确定性和乐趣。\n\
    \    2.  通过持续提问和互动，逐渐提高对方的购买意愿和性吸引力。\n    3.  通过了解对方的情况和逻辑，更好地掌握局势，保持自信和控制。"
  text: If I'm like you know what，Are you from LA，And she's like yeah。I might be like
    oh cool，You know I love LA blah blah blah blah blah，But the other 20% of the time。What
    am I gonna do，I'm going to go against the flow of things，It's like oh are you
    from LA。Oh really you're from LA，Fuck you I hate LA，OK like a little push。OK and
    that there adds some polarity，It adds you know those challenges。Like oh shit like
    it's unpredictable，It's all over the place，And that's how I'll bounce。You know
    in between OK，So 80% pull 20% push，Now don't take this dogmatically，Don't be like
    oh 80%。Oh my god am I doing 80%，It's a random number，It's just to give you a general
    idea。OK and then what do you do，You just keep on，You know doing more of the same。OK
    you just keep asking the questions，You just fluff in between，You have your nice
    push pull。You're sub communicating，Those three powerful，You know like adding to
    the fun，Challenging commanding。Overall you're acting through，The four pillars
    of inner game，You know being like sex worthy。Purposeful controlled，Floating self
    amused，And what's cool about this too。Is that as you keep this going，The buying
    temperature is going up，OK the more time you spend。Like the volume up，The download
    bar，You know getting you know towards sex。And by asking the interview，More questions
    you also find out，About the logistics。OK so everything just，Coms together that
    way。
