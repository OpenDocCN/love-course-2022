    think after any relationship。When a girl seriously feels，Like your family can't
    stay，In touch with her，I'm not sure I understand。What that question is，It's like，Are
    you saying that，We can rephrase that，Your family thinks that。They can stay in
    touch，With the girl you dated，I'm not really sure，But you can re-explain that。A
    little bit more，I'm going to do this，Other question here，It says，Hey our instructors，Always
    hustle。And sometimes cut their sleep，That's correct，How do you compensate，For
    sleep deprivation。Lots of coffee，I'm joking，I'm not sure，How do you compensate，For
    sleep deprivation。I know once you made a video，About the health routine，But it's
    enough to cut sleep。For a month or more，It depends，I mean，The sleep stuff I was
    talking about，Is I have a。We all have a process，That we go through for sleep，So
    all these instructors，The thing is。We travel in time zones，And I'm on about 100
    airplanes，A year，I'm on a city，A world tour this year。A hundred airplanes this
    year，In different time zones，So what happens is。The sleep cycle gets all kind
    of，Messed up，Your circadian rhythm，They call it。Can get kind of all jumbled up，So
    with that，You want to be having maybe，If you're trouble sleeping。You're going
    to be making your bedroom，A place of quarantine，So no cell phones。No laptops in
    your bedroom，You're going to get blackout-wide，

  text: So you have to eye mask。Once in a while for myself，I'll take either，Organic
    magnesium of some kind。Or the best kind of melatonin，That I can take，Before heading
    to sleep。Also meditating before sleep helps，Now the guys asking，Should you constantly，Cutting
    sleep early。I don't think so，I think it's better，To actually wake up early，Most
    of the successful people。That are out there，I think guys like，Barry Kanderjuk
    and Eric Thomas，All these guys talk about it。They say they get up early，When you
    get up early，And you can go to the gym early，It allows you to。It allows you to
    kind of，Get your day started，Before everybody else，And get a head start。And go
    to nap later on，In the afternoon if you want，But I would not cut sleep，For more
    than a month。More than a few weeks，I probably wouldn't do it，For two or three
    weeks，Two or three weeks。You're getting four or six hours，In the night，Six hours
    but after that，I would definitely get back。To the eight hours a night asleep，Because
    when you do，For too long。Your brain just starts to go crazy，And your energy reserves
    get less，You have less of a deep pocket。Energy just happens to you，When you need
    it，So definitely don't cut sleep。For more than three or four weeks，Do it for a
    little bit，But nothing more than that，OK。So get back to Daniel's question here，Of
    asking about when，A girl is part of your family。And you grow apart，Yeah and he's
    saying，So you part of your family，Grow apart。And there's nothing there anymore，And
    you think you know，
- summary: '-   人们在结束一段关系时，有些人会努力留在你的生活中，而有些人则不会。重要的是要给彼此时间去疗伤和移情别恋，避免将对方塑造成坏人或受害者。友谊需要时间来建立，不能立刻成为朋友，需要等待一段时间让情感平复。最终，当双方都真正走出过去时，才能成为真正的朋友。'
  text: The other side or just end it。It's a very tough question，I think some people，Want
    to stay in your life。And they'll make the effort to，And some don't，What I want
    to，This is a little late for you。To ask this，But whenever I'm going to go，I always
    ask her，So tell me about your ex boyfriend。Tell me about your ex relationships，Because
    I can see，She makes all of her exes，Into villains。I can see how she treats her
    exes，She's still friends with them，Something like that。It's a very important thing，You
    never really know，The girl makes you into the villain。And her into a victim，But
    you can't be friends，You might have to wait，Six months。For all that drama to settle，And
    then you can be friends after，But it's very hard to be friends。Right away，You
    might have to take some time，You can't be friends right away。Because she needs
    the time to heal，She needs the time to get over you。And kind of make you into
    a bad person，And make you not a bad person，And also lose the risk。Of you get back
    together，And your friends，That your relationship never really ended。It's kind
    of like，It's continuing on this friendship，This friendship story，This friendship
    identity。But it never really ended，So you might have to take six months，Couple
    of months off。Of you in contact，Not having contact，And then hopefully，When all
    that's done。You can get back together，Six months later，And be an actual legit
    friend。When you see both have really moved on，So Daniel，I hope that answers your
    question there，Yeah。so Justin asked，

  text: A really interesting question here，This might be the。The second last question
    I'll take here，I'll take one more question，I'll take one more after this。Justin
    asked，He says，While in Chicago，I dated a few dentists，Surgeons and vicious women。I
    prefer to be with women like this，But what advice would you give，Guarding managing
    expectations。Of high profile women，As the usual expectation，Is for a relationship，The
    more and more。They find out about me，Good question，It sounds like you're dating
    women。That are maybe in their 30s I think，It's mostly an age thing，Right，Like
    if a woman is like say，34 35。She's gonna be expecting，She's gonna，Her biological
    clock is ticking，She hates hearing about this。But it's called the sexual market
    value，A biological clock is ticking，She wants to settle down。If a woman's younger，Then
    there's also a possibility，That you could still hang out。But have your time，It's
    gotta be very very clear，Expectations right，She's not gonna think that you。She's
    gonna get you in a relationship，Unless you tell her that it's possible。If you
    tell her that you're，You're very clear on the part，Of being here，And saying that
    you're not。You're not wanting a relationship right now，That's what makes you really
    into。You know the space for it，You don't have time for it，And explain the reasons。Why
    you don't want it right now，I think it'll be clear，It's literally like sitting
    down。And talking about it，It's not like I think you say，Oh yeah I'm not looking
    for a relationship。

  text: So you really have to just，Have a conversation，With one whole copy，Or one
    whole phone conversation。Pretend that it's about this thing，Because they will，They
    will overthink it，Or overlook it。You know myself，I'm at a very funny point right
    now，I would love to have a relationship。But when I just see，What happens in relationships，And
    how people get so bitter，So like dank。And like how not nasty they get，It turns
    me off from the idea，Of having a relationship。You know things like，It's crazy，It's
    crazy what happens，Sometimes when they're over，Your best friend。Your best friend
    can almost become，Like an arch enemy，Or a problem in your life，After it's over。So
    the idea of having a relationship，Actually kind of turns me off，You know I would
    love to have one。If the right person came along，It would take a lot to get me
    into one，Now to the last question here。Here we go，Last question，I think by Ed
    or Eid，I'm not sure if I pronounced that right，E-E-D。I don't know if you held
    the keyboard，Down a little bit longer，There's a post there。What happened there，I'm
    not really sure，This question is，Hey Madison，What are your recommendations。For
    holding a relationship，With all people，If you are having a mobile life。I drive
    up and down California，And work and only stay in LA，And San Diego。For two to three
    days at a time，Good question，This is something that we deal with a lot。As RLC
    instructors，I've actually been playing around，This a lot，And I've been teaching
    this。To the other guys，Some of the assistants，

  text: And I've been asking them，What's my strategy for。Longest relationship，Any
    time，Most important thing is，There's a few things，Okay。So one of the first things
    is，I use a lot of，Phone calls and video chat，I try to not text。I try to phone
    call and video chat，Every two to three days，I think that if you don't do that。There's
    no，If you don't phone call and video chat，The relationship cannot get a rhythm
    to it。So when you，So let's say you text somebody，Texting is just words on a screen。They
    can read it with whatever emotion they want，They can think whatever they want。When
    they're reading it，When you video chat or you，When you video chat or you。Even
    an audio message or somebody，I think it helps a lot，So the cool thing about iPhones。Is
    they have this audio message feature，Which is not a voicemail，But a regular audio
    feature。And so you kind of just go here，You guys can see this here，And you press
    this little button here。It's like an up sign，Is that an up sign，Yeah it's not
    working。Well usually there's a little microphone there，And you can record a voice
    message。And they get it directly，To the text messages，And that's a lot better
    than texting。Because there's personality，There's voice，There's emotion，There's
    tone in it。I heard that Tony Robbins doesn't send emails，I heard that Tony Robbins
    only sends。Like 30 second voicemails through emails，So that's what he does a lot。So
    I think when you're on the road，And you're traveling a lot，It's important to do
    voicemails。And video chat，

    and you were chatting at 5 o'clock，Like you have like a schedule time，With the

    go with the flow。I want to be，I want to just do it when it feels right，Like this
    is not going to work。For your lifestyle，There's unfortunately there's not a place，For
    these people in your lifestyle。Because they're going to take up，All of your time，They're
    not going to value the free time。You have available，Okay，Something me and Brandon，Had
    a lot actually before，Brandon Carter。You're just in two different worlds，You're
    in two different worlds，They don't understand。The short time that you have available，So
    you got to apply，To the respects of your time。It's probably going to be，Somebody
    that has a job，That's similar，A bartender。That has a weird schedule，A consultant，A
    flight attendant，A lawyer，Who has to schedule everything。It's going to be somebody，That
    also has a time，That's not that flexible。And has to have their fun schedule，It's
    more fun to schedule your fun。It's going to be one of those people，It'll probably
    be a person like that，But。It's mostly a personality thing，And try to find somebody，That
    understands that。And then use those tools of，FaceTime，Of Facebook video chat，And
