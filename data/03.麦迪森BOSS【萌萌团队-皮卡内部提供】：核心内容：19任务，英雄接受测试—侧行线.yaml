  text: '# 03.麦迪森BOSS【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：核心内容：19任务，英雄接受测试—侧行线Hey， what''s up？ What''s good？，What
    is really good？，What''s really really good？ How you doing？。Thank you for coming
    back。 Thank you for being here。，I''m here for you。，Welcome to mission number two。，Mission
    number two， here we go。，So last week''s mission， you did the meditating on the
    dance floor。。Very basic， very much of a foundation。，And today we''re going to
    continue on with that foundation even more。，We''re going to take that lesson that
    we had， the awareness，。and from the dance floor stimulation all around us，， and
    we''re going to enhance it。。We''re going to turn it up just a notch。，Just a notch，
    just a little bit。，Now。what we''re going to have you do this weekend，， or even
    this week， or you know，。pay up as a day or a weekend for you，， is going to be
    interesting。。It''s actually probably one of my least favorite things to do in
    reality。，I hate doing it。I absolutely hate doing it。，The reason I hate doing it
    is because。I just don''t enjoy this kind of contact with people at all。，It''s
    one of my pet peeves。。And because it''s my pet peeve， it irritates me。，It frustrates
    me。，I get pissed off when it happens。。I think it''s going to be amazing。，I''m
    going to do that for you。，I''m going to tell you all about it。。And you''re going
    to experience that as well。，The pet peeve I have is this。。I hate when I''m out
    on the downtown somewhere，， and I''m just walking in my own business，。just going
    to a store， just like I''m in a rush。，And I seem to always get bumped。'
- summary: "-   人们在行走时缺乏对周围环境的感知，只顾自己的事情。\n    1.  他们不会避让别人，也不在乎别人的行进方向。\n    2. \
    \ 他们被困在自己的小世界里，只关心自己的问题。\n    3.  作者讨厌这种行为，呼吁大家走直线，保持礼貌和注意他人。\n-   选择繁忙的街区，找到中间的人行道线，直行多次。\n\
    \    1.  第一次只是简单地直行，类似于行走冥想。\n    2.  保持自己的步调，不要随着他人的快速步伐走。\n    3.  通过这种练习，提高自己的行走意识和礼貌。"
  text: 。Somebody just bumps into me。，I'm walking my lane。，I'm doing my thing。，I'm
    trying to get somewhere。。And they walk into me。，They don't walk around me。，They
    have no sensory awareness。。They don't give a fuck， to be honest， where I'm going。，They
    don't care where I'm going。。They're so trapped in their own little world， of where
    they got to go and their problems。。They don't have the decency to look at somebody
    else， who's coming in the direction。。I absolutely hate that。，So your mission is
    to walk in a straight line。，That's it。。Sounds pretty simple， right？，You pick a
    block。，The busiest block downtown that you can find，。maybe a block that's like
    a minute，， a minute， minute and a half to walk down。。And you just literally find
    a spot on the cement。，Most cements will have those blocks，。and you should be able
    to find a line on the block。。You find a line on the block that goes all the way
    down， to the end of the block，。and it should be in the middle of the sidewalk，，
    not too far to the left， like on the curb，。not too far to the right，， so you're
    close to the buildings。， You don't want to avoid trees。obviously，， but straight
    down the middle of the sidewalk。。And your mission is to just walk straightforward，
    several times。。The first time you're going to do this，， you're just going to walk
    in a straight line。。As you do this，， it's almost like a walking meditation， okay？，You
    walk at your own rhythm。。You don't walk fast。，So if everybody's like speeding，
    speeding fast，， you don't walk fast。。
- summary: "-   保持自己的节奏和速度，不受他人影响，即使碰到阻碍也不改变。教训是学会不受外界影响，了解人们更关心自己而非他人。\n    1.  保持自己的步调和速度，不受他人干扰。\n\
    \    2.  不要试图适应他人的步调或调整自己的速度。\n    3.  了解人们更关心自己而非他人，他们被困在自己的世界里。"
  text: You walk at your own rhythm， your own speed， okay？，Your own rhythm， your own
    speed。。And you don't change no matter what，， no matter who walks into you，， no
    matter who cuts you off，。no matter who's running into you。，You just keep going
    at this speed，， at your own rhythm。。Either you're like this， your own speed， your
    own rhythm。，Either you're going like this。your own speed， your own rhythm。，And
    that's super clutch， super key。。What you're going to notice is that， it's kind
    of uncomfortable to keep your rhythm。while it's other people around you。，You're
    going to feel like you want to fit into what they're doing。，You're going to feel
    like you want to adjust。，You're going to feel like you want to kind of compensate。，Don't，
    because the majority of them won't。，I expect you to knock into people。，That's
    what I expect。。I expect you to hit your shoulder。，I expect if you have a bad clue，。you're
    going to knock it in from your hand。，It's going to teach you a very valuable lesson。。It's
    going to teach you about yourself。，First of all， that lesson is going to be，，Hey。people
    don't care that much about me。，And number two， it's going to teach you that people
    care。so much about themselves that they're trapped in themselves。，So everybody's
    so concerned about。the way that they're perceived，，they're not even worried about
    the way that。you think you're perceived。，They're so concerned about how they look，and
    what they're doing。and what they're going about doing in their day。，Okay， so it's
    interesting。。

  text: That's a concept in game where，you think that everybody's so concerned about
    your opener，。but really they don't give a fuck at all。，So it helps you to relax
    and let go of that。，Now。that's the first thing，when you walk down the street。，The
    other time you walk down the street，。you're going to do it just looking at your
    feet。，You're going to keep walking on the street，。same pace， same rhythm。，But
    I want you to look down at the ground，at only your feet。and notice that there's
    a difference。，Notice that there's a difference。。Notice what happens when you do
    it this time。，I used to read books sometimes。。I noticed that whenever I read a
    book，，nobody would bump into me。。They were suddenly aware of their environment，and
    they'd avoid me。。Whenever I tried to just walk somewhere normal，，people would
    always bump into me。。It's really strange how that works， right？，So I want you
    to do that。。Notice the difference when you're，aware of other people。and notice
    the difference when you're walking down the street，and you're not aware of other
    people。。You're just looking directly at your feet。，I want you to post the results。，Post
    the results。write the results，，share them in the nation，，show them in the boss
    group on the app，。share them in the boss Facebook group。，But also，，I want you
    to be aware of how you felt when you did it。，That's something to learn。，Not just
    about what was the result，，what was the physical thing。that happened in the space
    around you，，but also what did you experience？，

    did you see happen to you，when that was going on？，Okay？，Be still for a moment。，Think
    about it。，Listen， look， feel，and then post that。，Alright？。So that's the mission
    for this week。，And I'll see you soon。。
