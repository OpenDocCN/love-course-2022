    would be more careful，More cautious。Not about what to spend，But just to know where
    I'm spending it，To be more informed。Every time I went to the bank machine，I would
    press that button that says，Do you want to receipt。I wouldn't just turn a blind
    eye to it，And say I don't want to know，What my financial situation is。I'd actually
    read the receipt，I'd be more conservative in my spending，Instead of taking regular
    Uber。I'd take an Uber pool，Or take public transit，And leave half an hour earlier。There's
