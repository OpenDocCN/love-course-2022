  text: '# 托德-《吸引力解锁》：21-资格Qualification，Right，Getting the girl to tell you why she''s
    cool，Or why you should be with her。Well number one，We talk about commitment and
    consistency，Right，Getting her to qualify。Definitely plays into that，And also getting
    her to qualify says，I''m a high value guy。I''m selective etc etc，So very very
    powerful，And that''s why it works，Okay，Also understand this。By knowing why these
    things work，It helps you to know when to do them，Okay，If you understand。The reason
    you''re doing them，It helps you to use them at the right places，Right，So for example，If。If
    you''re already way too high value，You wouldn''t use disqualifiers。Because if
    you understand what the disqualifiers do。You''d know that that''s counterproductive
    in that case，Okay，So understanding the why，Matters a lot。I see a lot of guys they
    go out and like，Like，Oh I saw Max do this，I saw Julian do this。I saw you do this，And
    they mindlessly repeat these lines，Completely out of context，Right。Understanding
    the why helps you contextualize it，And do it in the right place。'
