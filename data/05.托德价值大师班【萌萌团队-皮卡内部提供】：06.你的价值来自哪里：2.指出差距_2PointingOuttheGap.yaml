    the gap between who someone is conveying that they are，and who they actually are。。So
    think of it this way。，You know everything about yourself。，You know all your own
    insecurities。。You know all your own worst qualities。，You know all your own best
    qualities。。But when you go into the world，，you try and highlight those best qualities。and
    you try and hide those worst qualities。，So you''re putting a presentation into
    the world of one thing。when in fact you know that you''re another thing。，That''s
    true for just about everybody。。And most people are trying in some way to be something
    or not，。especially people who are aspirational，or like a little confident or ostentatious。。They''re
    putting something out there that is you know。what they''d like to be rather than
    necessarily what they are。。Or something or maybe they''re putting out a slightly
    more favorable impression of themselves。。If you can point out that gap，，then you''re
    going to do really well。，So one example of this，。which can bring up kind of a
    mark examples，is dealing with other guys in an interaction。。One example is if
    you call out the guy for doing game，，so to speak。。You didn''t say you''re doing
    game or whatever，，but if you say wow， you''re like you know，。that''s very smooth。，You''re
    like where''d you get that line from？。Something like that is you''re putting him
    under a lot of pressure。because he''s trying to be this like cool social guy，and
    it''s just happening。。'
- answers: '-   Someone can be put in a double bind situation by making them justify
    or qualify themselves when pointing out the gap between their presentation and
    reality, for example, by calling out someone for doing game or teasing someone
    wearing a Ferrari jacket.

    -   Pointing out the gap between someone''s presentation and reality can have
    a big impact as it highlights the difference between who someone is conveying
    that they are and who they actually are. Most people try to highlight their best
    qualities and hide their worst qualities when presenting themselves to the world,
    so pointing out that gap can lead to success.

    -   Complimenting a Ferrari jacket can tease someone into acknowledging the truth
    by making them handle the pressure of acknowledging whether they actually have
    the car or not. It creates a gap between who the person is presenting themselves
    as and who they actually are.

    -   Authenticity is important in interactions because most people can tell when
    someone is being fake or insincere. To avoid fake behavior, it''s important to
    be aware of the gap between one''s presentation and reality, and to stay true
    to oneself.

    -   Some strategies for highlighting the importance of authenticity in interactions
    include noticing when someone is being silly and catching them in that moment,
    treating particularly hot girls as cute and silly instead of just acknowledging
    them as hot, and pointing out the gap when someone is dressed up to dress down.
    By doing so, one can create a more authentic interaction.'

  text: Where you point out that like game is in progress。。Now it puts him in a weird
    situation where he'd be like，。I'm not doing game and justify himself and qualify
    himself。，Or he can go along with you know，。oh yeah， no， I'm really good at this。，And
    now he's qualifying himself。。So you put him in this interesting double bind。，Another
    interesting one，。it's not necessarily the most practical，，but it's a good example
    for illustrating the concept。is if you saw someone wearing like those Ferrari
    jackets，or something like that，。you'd be like oh dude， nice jacket， man。，The car's
    outside， right？。And you're kind of like just joking with him，，teasing with him，。but
    he has to like kind of acknowledge，，he has to handle that。，It's like no， I don't
    have the car。just the jacket， right？，Or he can try and be like，，oh no， I love
    the car at home。and just try and be all like， you know，， try and play it off or
    something like that。when you know it's not true，and it just comes off very， very
    fake。，So here what you're doing is。you're pointing out the gap between，who they

  text: it wouldn't be the optimal timing。，You'd much rather，find a casual moment，to
    approach these girls，，i。e。 if they were standing，more near you，or if you were
    walking past，or something like that。。So it is somewhat of a difficult，approach
    in that realm，just because it's very obvious。you're approaching。，If you had to
    go，，if you had to start the conversation，in an obvious way，。one thing you could
    do，is just make it，not a particularly sexual，conversation at first。and just work
    socially，and be the social fun guy，and then bring the intentfulness，later on。。So
    even potentially，old school opinion opener，could be good for this，kind of a group
    situation。where there's no kind of，soft point in the group。，So those are different
    approaches。that could work there，as far as it goes。，The second one，，a situation
    where I absolutely。can't talk to you，is a situation where I absolutely，would not
    approach。，I'll explain why。how I would approach in general。，But the reason I would
    not approach，is this girl is clearly has。she's being photographed， right？，She's
    clearly being photographed。，She clearly looks a certain way。。And， you know，，interrupting
    that would be，extremely try hard，，extremely not calibrated， etc。。If you were to
    approach this girl，at a different time，，so she's clearly，like blatantly well-dressed，。like
    ridiculously，accessorized perfectly，，everything matches，，like her purse。matches
    her dress and her top。，I thought actually when I first saw it，。I thought her purse
    matched her top，，
- answers: '-   The significance of the matching plaid purse with the outfit lies
    in its meticulous coordination, suggesting a level of attention to detail and
    fashion sense that some may perceive as excessive or try-hard.

    -   The outfit is described as impeccably well-dressed, with every element carefully
    coordinated to create a polished look. It is noted that the girl''s attire, including
    the perfectly matching plaid purse, may be perceived as over the top or extravagant.

    -   Considering the event the girl is dressed for is important because it indicates
    whether the approach would be appropriate and whether the person approaching would
    naturally fit into the context of the event. It also suggests the possibility
    of avoiding a cold approach if one already belongs to or is connected with the
    event.

    -   Cold approach might not be necessary when the person approaching already belongs
    at the event or knows someone there. In such cases, they may have a more organic
    opportunity to engage with the individual without resorting to a cold approach.

    -   The suggested approach in situations where one belongs at the event and knows
    someone there is to leverage existing connections or familiarity with the event
    to initiate interaction. This could involve avoiding a direct cold approach and
    instead engaging socially or through mutual acquaintances before gradually introducing
    intentfulness into the conversation.'
  questions: '-   What is the significance of the matching plaid purse with the outfit?

    -   How is the outfit described in the paragraph?

    -   Why is considering the event the girl is dressed for important?

    -   When might cold approach not be necessary, according to the paragraph?

    -   What is the suggested approach in situations where one belongs at the event
    and knows someone there?'
  summary: "-   The paragraph discusses the ridiculousness of a girl having a perfectly\
    \ matching plaid purse with her outfit, suggesting that pointing out this gap\
    \ could be interesting. \n    1.  The outfit is described as over the top or try\

  text: which would be even more ridiculous。，But since it's a dress，。it's a little
    less ridiculous，，but it's still ridiculous。，Like what kind of girl。has a perfectly
    matching plaid purse，for her like perfectly matching like top， right？。So something
    along the lines of that，，pointing out that gap，could be interesting， right？。Pointing
    out the gap，that it is a little，over the top or a little try hard。。So and the
    other thing to think about，is what kind of event this is。。So if a girl is a dress
    like this，，she's probably dressed for an event。。So hopefully you belong at that
    event。，Hopefully you're a dress well at that event。。Hopefully you fit in at that
    event。，And in that case，，you might not even have to do a cold approach。because
    you might be hopefully，someone at that event as well，or at least know someone。or
    something like that。，So you could also avoid cold approach，in this kind of a situation。。And
    a lot of times，，the issue with celebrity girls，isn't even that they're harder
    to approach。。It's the problem of access。，It's the problem of like actually，getting
    to a situation。where you could approach them。，But in terms of pointing out the
    gap，，couple things you could do。is you could say something about like，，do you
    like the outfit？，I just have to ask though，。do you always like，，you know，get the
    matching，，matching purse for every shirt you own？。Something like that。，And then
    the idea of like，，I love the outfit，，but you know，。it is a little over the top。，You
    could say something。，

  text: that if you just are in a conversation。with the girl on a level playing field，，that
    you'll do fine from there。。So you don't have to knock it out of the park，on your
    opener。。And you don't want to be super try hard，on your opener。，So I hope that
    helps a little bit。in terms of some ideas of push pull。，And basically this idea
    of finding the gap。，Right？。Finding that gap between who they're trying to be，and
    what they are。，So this girl，，you know，。in the last one，，she's very elegant，，but
    it's also like a little over the top，and ridiculous。。Like who even owns a pair
    of gloves like that，，for example。，Okay。，By the way，，one comment actually，。because
    there are a lot of funny comments，in the chat，，but ones that are actually flat
    out insulting。，like how many prostate exams did you do tonight？，That kind of stuff。，It's
    funny。，It's really funny。。It would also be probably a really bad opener。，At least
    as your first opener。，Right？。If you would have been talking for a while，and then
    you were joking around about the gloves。and then you said that maybe。，But if you
    started off with something。that's full on insulting at the start，，it probably
    wouldn't work very often。。It would just be too like you tried to be negative。，Why
    did you go approach。and then try and be negative？，Whenever you're doing something
    that is negative，。it should be kind of subtle，and it just happened as opposed
    to，really put on and try hard。。
