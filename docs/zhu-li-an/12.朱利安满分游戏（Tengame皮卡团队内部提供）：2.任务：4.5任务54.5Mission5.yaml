  text: '# 12.朱利安满分游戏（Tengame皮卡团队内部提供）：2.任务：4.5任务54.5Mission5I adored you before I
    laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，I''m not too sure，I just can''t take my eyes。Can''t
    take my eyes off you，This is Julian and welcome to mission number five。Now before
    we crack into this one here，a few things first， okay，Number one。this is usually
    around the time，that people start falling off。in terms of going out and following
    the missions，You know， if you scroll through the Facebook group。there are a lot
    of mission one posts，there are a lot of mission two posts，Mission three。a little
    bit less，and mission four， even less，Okay， so if this is you，if you identify with
    this。you''re like， oh， fuck yeah，I kind of stagnated，I kind of gave up on the
    missions。First thing you want to do，is watch the accountability teleconference，Okay。I
    uploaded the replay here below，so scroll down and watch that。and do whatever you
    can to just jump back out there，to get your ass out in the field，And number two。remember
    that these missions，like they''re not meant for you，to achieve perfection， okay。They''re
    just meant to give you，a better sense of direction，Don''t aim for perfection。Just
    focus on the direction，so you''re not just dabbling while out，Okay， if you go
    out， for example。say seven days a week， say you miss a day，It''s not the end of
    the world，You know。I see a lot of posts where，you know， guys are just kind of，beating
    themselves up。This is not what the missions are designed to be，Okay， this is not
    another reason。'

  text: for you to beat yourself up，and disapprove of yourself。It's just to give you
    some direction while out，Okay， so remember，Number one。it's like really value the
    fun，above all else，If the missions are killing that fun。go back and you know，let
    go of the missions temporarily，or don't aim for so much like perfection。until
    you kind of get that fun vibe back，and then add the missions on top of that，Okay。because
    if you're going out，and you're not having a blast，Yeah， you're doing your seven
    days a week。Yeah， you're doing the assignments，but you're missing the whole point
    that is game，Okay。so that's the first thing，And the second is last week，Okay，
    mission number four。I asked you to post some screen caps，of different text exchanges，in
    terms of setting up a date。and I thought we could crack into，three of them here，The
    first one，Okay。this brings up some interesting points，The first one starts like
    this，Okay， so you got her number。and you text her your name，This is at 3。07 a。m。，At
    3。39， she texts you back a wink，Okay。and then there's pretty much nothing，till
    the next day，If she texts you back a wink at 3。39。unless you committed to another
    girl，unless you went home with another girl。unless you had to go home early，that's
    a lead you wanna be fucking calling。like that's one of those numbers，at the end
    of the night，say hey， where are you at？，Let's hang out。Let's go for after I was
    through，Let's go for fucking drink，Hey， what's going on？，versus，Oh。I'll just let
    it slide，Okay，

  text: ' what I usually do is again，I''ll text them my name。around halfway through
    the night，I''ll be texting them where are you？，and yeah。don''t let a lead like
    that die，Okay， so the next day，you still text her， which is good。you''re like
    hello，are we still hanging out today？，Her answer is no， I can''t，She''s like hi，
    I can''t。Next question is hey， so when are you free？，Now be careful with this
    one here，like these open-handed。like when are you free？，That''ll rarely go somewhere，you
    wanna be decisive and precise with your text。It''s like hey， let''s do this，at
    this time， this day，versus so when are you free？，You know，then。you wait a bit，then
    you text her like I hate you，like immediately it''s like I hate you。It''s like
    extremely reactive，communicating and care way too much，She''s still engaged though。her
    answer is，She''s like why， winky face，and then，your answer is well，because your
    hair is too dark。you eat too little meat，and you need 8 days， 16 hours，and 29
    minutes to respond to a message。don''t they seem， you know，like sufficient reasons，now
    again，the whole texting like keeps on going。it doesn''t kill it，but immediately
    that''s like，it''s just like extremely try hard off the bat。the fact that you''re
    counting the days，and hours and minutes，is it''s just such a big deal。you remember
    it''s like，the frame of mind when texting，is like how would you text。if you''re
    in the middle of an orgy，with 10 models，would you be like，oh it was 8 minutes。like
    you wouldn''t care，it''d be like way more casual，'

  text: okay for a girl it's not a big deal。if you make it into a big deal，it seems
    like you know，one you're lower value，and number two。it puts a lot of pressure
    on her too，to kind of live up to the date。because it's like so important for you，so
    more casual，also don't expect a girl to be free。the first time you suggest hanging
    out，you know especially here，it's like you text her at 1。she was out till，you
    know like 3。40 here，so probably till like 4 or 5 a。m。。you're like hey we still
    hanging out，she's probably tired as fuck at that time。she answers hey I can't，okay
    so something to keep in mind，then you keep texting here。there's some back and
    forth，you text her some pictures，you text some videos back and forth。she's still
    engaged which is good，it's kind of showing your personality。but the you don't
    want to fall into，like that frame where you're like，now her little texting buddy。you
    know it's like kind of going back and forth，guys will do this where，again you
    start texting。and now you're friends over text，but you never hang out in person，because
    you don't want to ruin。that texting buddy vibe，like what if it's awkward，if we
    meet in person。and it just doesn't really move it forward，so yeah you know，it's
    like you're still texting her。it's like hey what are you doing，tomorrow night
    so that's good，hey let's drink tomorrow。you know maybe try like，I'd say calling
    her first of all，like versus these little videos。back and forth，and you know maybe
    try something else，then you know let's hang out，

    bit，don't just repeat it over and over。you know it's like hey，I'm doing this you
    should come，hey what about this，or hey I'm in the area。like make it easy on her，that's
    another one too，it's like for the date，make it easy。you have her logistics，you
    know what area she lives in，be like hey I'm in this place。what are you doing，you
    know call her，now it's not like，oh there's this big deal。there's this huge date，it's
    probably just stuff to walk out，and you set up you know a bar nearby。or doing
    something nearby，so that's the first one，the second one，this is a short one。the
    first text is，are you and your bike busy tonight，so most likely call back to，humor
    in the text。you know that's good，it's like again there's a purpose，it's like hey，are
    you busy tonight，her answer。she's like haha only me，I have your rehearsal till
    11 p。m。，your text immediately after that。is hey we'll come have tea，at my place
    after，so it's like the first text，like at 11 p。m。。it's like hey come and have
    tea，at my place，you know pretty much，be a slut for me。so again you're asking，for
    so much compliance，or putting her on the spot，making her seem like a slut。there's
    no way she's gonna be like，sure let's go for tea，at 11 p。m。，at your place。directly
    at your place，so obviously there's no answer，and then you text again。oh sorry
    I have to withdraw the offer，I'm too tired，extremely reactive，so again be aware
    of like。you know how much compliance，

    cool activity。but like is it really moving it，towards sex，not really，you know
    it's like，the best date to location。the best date location，is a little side note，is
    like the shitty bar next to。like the closest bar to your bed，that's the best location，and

    side。of the spectrum，okay so，these are some lessons to get out of these。I'd also

    out you need to have those，you know forty five minutes。to an hour and a half sets，and
    if your interaction is just like。five ten minutes nothing's gonna happen，now you
    can practice this，while out obviously in a bar club。but during the day，you can
    kind of ease your way there，you know it's like there。there's probably gonna be
    a lot of girls，like sitting out，you know in fucking summertime。like sitting out
    on a，you know at a little restaurant，on a patio at a coffee shop。and it's easy
    to kind of，just sit down and start chatting，
