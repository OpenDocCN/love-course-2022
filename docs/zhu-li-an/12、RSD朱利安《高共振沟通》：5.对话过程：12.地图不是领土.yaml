  text: '# 12、RSD朱利安《高共振沟通》：5.对话过程：12.地图不是领土Mindset is going out，This is all very
    key，Give up on this idea of having a perfect interaction。We''re conditioned that
    way，You might even go through some of the ideas here。And start thinking that things
    will fall according to plan，You have all your ducks in a row。It''s like well first
    of all say this，And then that person will say this。And then I''ll read their social
    cues，And I''ll do this and the behavioral cues，Sure， that''s the map。But the map
    of course is never the territory，And every single interaction is gonna be messy。Every
    single interaction at some point，Or at many points is going to go，Not according
    to plan。And this freaks people out，Right， where they can''t adapt to reality，They
    value the model。Which is what we''re breaking down here， right？，This is a conceptual
    model，They value that。They value the map over real life，Don''t make that mistake，Real
    life。That information you''re getting in front of you，Trust that over any kind
    of theory concept idea。Mental map， mental model，You name it，Enjoy times where
    it doesn''t go according to plan，Right。it''s great to have very accurate，You could
    say anticipated，You know， skills，Right。anticipated skills where，For example， when
    I talk to someone，I can read them being modest very fast。Which allows me to then
    connect with them，On a much deeper and authentic level。But then I also am able
    to really anticipate，A lot of what they''re going to do or say。Or the direction
    the whole interaction is going to go in，'

  text: And this allows me once more。To make it a lot more win-win，However， if suddenly
    they veer off，From what I anticipate。From the mental model，I will always adapt
    to reality，And I will enjoy that，Okay。it adds that unpredictability，It adds a
    bit of that，You know， spark to an interaction。And you're like wow， this is new，Right，
    if everything went according to plan，It'd be very boring。Okay， so give up on that
    idea，Of a perfect interaction，Messiness is good，Okay， socializing is messy。There's
    going to be curve balls，Throwing at you left and right，You think everything will
    be fine。Suddenly someone else comes in，You're talking to this person，Things will
    go according to plan。You say the wrong thing，They say the wrong thing，It's this
    whole mess，And you could say。Someone who's really good socially，A social master
    is someone who's，Able to stay very grounded。And okay in that chaos，Right， it's
    a positive chaos，Where two entities who are different。Are trying to find common
    ground，And mesh and connect together，On different topics or wavelengths。Or emotions，
    you name it，Of course it's going to be messy，And that's what makes it so exciting。And
    so fun，So embrace that， okay，Don't sweat the small stuff，Don't get too anal， right。With
    a lot of these ideas，That we've covered，You might be like，Well， I can never break
    this rule。Nothing that we covered is a rule，Okay， even though it might say rule，Sometimes
    it's not a rule。It's simply guidelines， right，You're going to break every single
    one，
- summary: '-   社交指南中强调不要为小事烦恼，社交是混乱的一部分，应该接受犯错和忘记的事实，尝试做一些与传统相悖的事情。学会应对挑战，保持冷静，预见未来，但最终要学会随遇而安，这就是社交技能的精髓。不是让现实适应你的地图，而是利用地图与现实建立更深层次、更真实的联系。'
  text: Of these guidelines。Don't sweat the small stuff， okay，Again， that's the whole
    part，Of socializing being messy。You should be making mistakes，You should be forgetting，About
    different things。You should be doing stuff，That you were taught the opposite，That's
    part of it all， okay。And lastly of course，Learn to roll with the punches，That's
    the skill。The person who can remain the most chill，Who has the most references，Which
    we're going to cover here。Who can anticipate the best，But ultimately，That just
    rolls with the punches，That's social skills。It's not making reality fit to your
    map，It's using the map to connect with reality。On a much deeper and more authentic
    level。
