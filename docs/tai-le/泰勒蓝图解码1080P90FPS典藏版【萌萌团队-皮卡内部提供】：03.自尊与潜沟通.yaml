    shining 關於計較， legacy and cleverness， certificates procedure， So this is н poetic，她想指的是
    bend。here a different，你有看看女 Demand，How long？，Have a second。，Like that， right？。Because
    you''re looking quickly at how she looks。，For a woman，。how long does it take her
    to decide if you have all those qualities？，Couple hours。 Think about it。。Can I
    train a guy？，Could you give me the most self-hating， nerdy guy in the world？，Even
    yourself。Say you''re going to teach somebody。，Could you take the most self-hating，
    nerdy guy in the world。and teach him how to approach a woman for the first 10
    seconds，and come across well for 10 seconds？。Could you do that？，Pretty easy， right？，Just
    give good eye contact， speak well， just walk up。，Dude。it''s just 10 seconds。 You
    can do that， right？，Okay。，So for a man。he''s pretty much willing to decide，whether
    or not to have sex with a woman very quickly。。A woman needs time。，And so unlike
    a man who just looks quickly at visual cues，。women look at what''s called behavioral
    cues。，So think a lot about that。，Remember that distinction。。It''s just a simple
    little distinction。，It''s called visual versus behavioral。，That''s the core。，Look。when
    I have confidence in myself，that I don''t need to go the superficial route，。'
- text: I don't need to go the social conditioning route，，that simple little distinction
    right here，。visual versus behavioral，，men tend to be visual， women tend to be
    behavioral，。like they're looking at your behavior patterns。，That's what makes
    me know that this stuff works。。All right？，You know， whenever you start to doubt
    yourself，，remember that simple distinction。。That's how you know， guys。，That is
    how you know this stuff works。。Women are looking at your behavior patterns。，They're
    looking at what's called subcommunication。。This is the communication that goes
    beneath the layers。，All right？，If you say， hello。how are you doing？，What's your
    name？ Where are you from？，That's the surface layer of communication。。What women
    are looking at is called，the subcommunication。，It's the communication beneath
    all of that。，So look， guys are turned on instantly，like a light switch。。Girls
    are turned on gradually like a volume knob。，Now when we're talking about subcommunication，。there's
    two types。，The first one is the cues in your behavior，。and the second are the
    cues in how people react to you。。And both are strong forms of subcommunication。，Think
    about a celebrity who does not have。very strong behavior at all。，He's weak。，But
    nonetheless， because he's a celebrity，。he has a lot of people reacting to him。，As
    a result， women might feel attracted。even though he's a chode。，Likewise， take
    a guy who is just，a normal guy。。And he meets a girl one on one。，Say you meet a
    girl one on one。。
- text: There's not anybody else reacting to you，，but she can still look at cues in
    your behavior。and make a decision on you。，Likewise， you could be in a situation，where
    you have both。。All three work equally well。，In the same way that a celebrity，can
    get countless girls just based on。how people are reacting to him，，even if his
    own behavior is not that strong。。If your behavior is strong，，even if you don't
    have a lot of people，reacting to you。you can be successful。，If you have both，
    that's also fine。，Now look， women are better at reading。subtle social cues than
    men are。，Understand that？，Most women are better at reading。subtle social cues。，Do
    you think it's impossible，to be able to learn how to read。subcommunication as
    well as a woman？，No。It is。You can do it。，You can learn it。，You can learn to read。subcommunication
    as well，，if not better than a woman， with time。，You can read it as well。if not
    better。，Now look，here are some examples。，Eye contact， vocal tonality，，body language。your
    sense of individuality，，humor and playfulness。，By the way， we're going to go through。these
    in much more detail later。，Comfort in your environment，。indifference to what people
    think of you，，your concepts and personal boundaries。of what you will and will
    not accept，，your control over your own emotions。and your own sense of reality，，your
    confidence to stay，what's on your mind and stand out，。your self-directedness，，conviction
    and grasp，of your own standards，，your sense of entitlement。
- text: and willingness to go for what you want。，That's a big one，guys。，Your sense
    of entitlement。and willingness to go for what you want。，You see a woman you want，，you
    go for it。。And the types of things that you say，and the emotion behind the ways
    you say them。all in relation to the other people there。，This is the subcommunication。。It's
    more important and says so much more，than the words that you say。。Think about
    it in evolutionary terms。，Think about it real carefully。。Say that you're the boss
    caveman。，Something happens。，You're no longer the boss caveman。。How do the women
    know，to drop you immediately？，They can feel it。，Yeah，the caveman's behavior changes。，Parts
    of his demeanor change。，Likewise，what if you have a Chode caveman。and then as
    the Chode caveman ages，，he gets new status，from the tribe。，How do the women know。to
    immediately start hooking up with him？，He starts behaving differently。。Starts
    behaving differently。，All right？，Real basic simple stuff。，Now here's where things
    get vexing。as a guy。，When you learn this stuff，，it's really tough，because you're
    learning it。and you learn the initial，subcommunication of an attractive guy。，And
    so what happens。is that a woman has，multipersonalities。，She has one personality，that
    she gives to people。who are attractive。，And she has another personality，that she
    gives to people，who are unattractive。。And so when you walk up，and initially you're
    communicating，attractive qualities about yourself，。she's going to react to you
    very well，and say，，
- text: you're so great。，I'm so glad I met you。。But then when you fall back，in your
    old Chodey behaviors，。suddenly she just blows you off immediately。，And this is
    what happens。，See，for a woman，。her appearance is not going，to change that quickly。，You
    could dump Goober all over her。and she would still look，relatively similar to
    what she looks like。，So as a man，。you've decided quickly。，For a woman， however，，your
    behaviors can change，second to second。。They change in real time，and they change
    quickly。，This is why when you're speaking，to a woman，。you can be speaking to her，and
    it's going amazing。，And then all of a sudden。it just starts to go downhill。，It
    just starts to go，down the toilet。，Because initially。you were behaving strong。，You
    were not attached to the outcome。，You were having fun。。You were in your own reality。，But
    then the next minute，，you start，you know，you go，。this girl is so cute。，Oh man，it's
    going to be great，if I hook up with this girl。。Suddenly you're coming from，a scarcity
    mindset，，not an abundance mindset。，She loses attraction。。She walks。，She goes，I
    have to go back，to my friends。，You say hi to her later。。She doesn't even wave
    back。，Because now you're in，the other zone。，It is constantly shifting。。If you
    want to imagine，what poor women deal with，，imagine if you had，this incredibly
    attractive girl。，You turn，you go like this。，And then you turn back，and she had
    like blimped out。。And like now she's wearing a muumuu，and she has a giant mustache。，That
    is what women deal with。
- text: for guys。，What's that？，Can you change it back？，Sure。，Yep，you can。，But once
    you've blown it，。it's better just not to have，blown it。，But the point is that
    sure，，you can，you know，，but you can。you know，，things can change，of course。，But
    anyway，，when the woman sees，these behaviors in you，。she's going to feel attracted。，And
    so even if logically speaking，，you're not the type of guy。that she goes for，，emotionally，，she's
    going to be responding to you。。Some of you guys might have wondered，why it is
    that a lot of the guys。who have jobs as teaching dating，are still able to be successful，with
    women，right？。Because wouldn't that sound funny？，Like you think that having a job，like
    mine。that as soon as a woman，finds out，oh，you teach guys，how to meet women，，she's
    immediately going to be。diswaited，right？，She's going to say，，oh，god，that，no，no，，none
    of that，right？，Well，that happens maybe。2% of the time，，but the other 98% of the
    time，，it makes no difference。，Like you could tell a girl，。you know，or rather，，I
    can tell a girl，，yeah，you know，，this is my job，，real social dynamics。。And she
    just goes，，oh，okay，and it doesn't，even register。，It's completely outside，her reality。。It
    doesn't register。，The words that you say，very rarely register to a woman。。You're
    thinking that they are，，but they're not，okay？，This is why I tell guys，。you can
    talk in total gibberish，to a woman。，The stuff that you can say，can make no sense。whatsoever
    at all。，And it can still be，totally fine。，Because what she's really，
- text: looking at is the。subcommunication。，Especially if she's becoming，attracted，the
    more attracted，she's becoming。the more the，actual words that you're saying，are
    really irrelevant。，And this is why when guys。are doing things like，，oh，look at
    this watch，，or like，oh，I have，this nice job，。they don't realize that，they're basically，，they're
    cutting off that，nice flow between you。and the girl。，Like you've got that nice，flow
    of communication，between you and the girl。and you're building，that chemistry，，as
    soon as you go logic on her，，you try to logically。convince her，like，，I can do
    this for you，or I have this stuff。，All that nice。subcommunication that was，going
    on between you，and the girl，just got cut off。，Typically，not always。。Don't go getting，paranode
    on me。，Anything that I say，，you need to experiment，with it to understand。what
    is that I'm saying，okay？，But the point is，，generally speaking，，that nice flow
    of。subcommunication and，attraction building，and chemistry building，，as soon as
    you go，logical on her，。like，let me do this for you，or let me show you，this that
    I have，，you've cut off the process。。You have snipped it。，All right？，Now，when we
    think about，you know，，what that means for you，。your value is not static。，You know
    how a girl's value，is fairly static to you？，Well。at least on the surface，，well，your
    value is not static。，Women are always feeling it。。Second by second，，minute by
    minute，，they're feeling it。，Your behavior can change，within seconds。。Attraction
    is a very fast，
- text: and straightforward process。，Get that in your heads，guys。，Okay。。Attraction
    is straightforward。，Attraction is straightforward。，Good。Good。。Attraction happens
    within seconds。，Attraction happens within seconds。，Good。Good。，It's so fast。。And
    this is why，if you're，a guy at home who's watching this，，and you've got that one
    special girl。that you think you're gonna get，and you think this program，is gonna
    fix that，，you're mistaken。。Because attraction either happens，or it doesn't。，She
    likes you or she doesn't。，With women。I personally come，from an abundance mindset。，I
    go talk to a girl。，If she likes me，that's nice。。If she doesn't like me，it's done。，I
    would never be thinking，，how could I change her mind？。I would never be thinking
    like that。，I would always just be thinking，，it's either on or it's not。。Obviously，as
    things progress，，when you're meeting a girl，，they can go like that，。and that's
    all part of the game。，That's fine。，But generally speaking，，I don't get crushes
    on girls。that don't like me。，Who here's ever had a crush，on a girl that didn't
    like them？。It's a fucking fool thing to have。，It makes no sense。，It's。。。，Yeah。，Not
    only is it just completely。counterproductive，，but it's actually shutting you down。，Because
    if you have a crush on a girl，。before you go see her，and you are attached to the
    outcome，，how's that gonna change your behavior？。You're gonna come up with passive，or
    you're gonna come up with reactive？，Reactive。attached to the outcome，，scarcity，，
- text: not the one who is the attractive one，in the situation。，Speak up。。Anyone that's
    talked，speak up。，Okay。，I remember a weird experience。，When I was teaching high
    school，。it was very weird。，At the time，，I couldn't feel what's going on。。I would
    have these very attractive girls，，like 15，16，，they would be like throwing themselves
    at me。。I was actually doing a lot of like IODing them。，I would show up wearing
    a wedding ring。and tell them I was married。，Because it actually got。。。，I didn't
    really figure out till now。what was going on。，Because it was like。。。，When I was
    in high school，，these girls at St。 May's，。they wouldn't pay any attention to me。，But
    I was a teacher up there，，and I was the alpha male，。and I was controlling the
    room。，The women were all over me。，They'd ask，，do you have a girlfriend？。Are you
    married？，It was actually ridiculous。，Yeah， because think of it this way。。Or they
    just wanted it。，If you want to。。。，Yeah。，Yeah。，And want it。，So the thing is。。。，No。I
    mean he's absolutely right。，And the thing is like with。。。，Say that you're the。。。，Again。when
    we talk about like evolution，，and what's interesting is that。in learning how to
    be successful with women，，we do talk a lot about like evolution。or cavemen and
    stuff like that。，And I understand from an outsider's perspective，。it seems totally
    wacky and kind of weird。，Like why would you be bringing this up？。And I understand
    that。，And it is counterintuitive。，But the reason that we talk about。is because
    we're trying to get to the root，
- text: of what it is。，And that's why we talk about it。，Yeah。。So basically，，if you
    think about the caveman，who is the most attractive，。and he has women swarming
    him。，So when he talks to a woman，。is he coming from a place of abundance or scarcity？，Abundance。，Abundance，
    right？，So look，。try to imagine it this way。，If you have had sex with like five
    girls today，。and you go to approach some other girl，to talk to her，，are you gonna
    feel nervous？，Of course not。right？，So the thing is，，how about if you have just
    like，not be late in a year， okay？。And there's a girl that might like you， okay？，You
    go， God， I really like you， okay？。Because there's that，，it creates neediness。，And
    that's why neediness is one of the reasons。why neediness is incredibly unattractive。，It's
    very hard for a woman，to sleep with a guy who's needy。，Because basically what
    she's saying to herself is，，if I sleep with this guy，。his kids will also be needy，，and
    then that's gonna be the last generation of kids，，okay？。Because they're not gonna
    get laid themselves，，if I have a son with this guy，，so I'm screwed。all right？，So
    that is why a woman is not gonna sleep with a guy。that's coming from a scarcity
    position。，Look， obviously it happens。，All of us probably， you know，。were successful
    with one or two women at some point，，even coming from a scarcity reality。。It's
    not totally the end of the world，，but it's certainly not the type，。it's not gonna
    lead to that rock star success，that we talk about in the sales copy，of this program。right？
- text: ，Okay？，So， all right， look。，Women aren't judging you on money。，Look， it's
    none of that。。They're judging you on value，，the way you act， the way people react
    to you，。and the deeper level of who you are。，Any other qualities are not the real
    deal，。and women are simply not wired，to have a response to them。，Now let's go
    a little bit deeper。。Let's go deeper on this topic。，Kind of lay the foundation，
    right？，Like we've recovered the basics。。You know， we've looked at the basics here。，All
    right？，So now we're gonna go deeper in。to what all this stuff means，，what it amounts
    to。，Objectification。，On some level。you've always known，that women were looking
    at you，as an object of value。，On some level。you've sensed it。，At some point， I
    don't care when，，you've sensed that women，are looking at you。as an object of value。，You
    have sensed it。，You have sensed it。，How do you know it？，If nothing else。on some
    level，，you have looked at them，as an object of value。，On some level。，So you've
    known it。for a long time。，The tendency is to try，to objectify yourself，，to try
    to turn yourself。into something that has value。，That's the tendency。，So we look
    around，，social conditioning。。We look at advertising，and the media，，which we're
    surrounded，by all the time。。We look at our social media，，and we look at our social
    media，，and we look at our social media，。we look at our peers。，And what does it
    tell us？，Does it tell you，，if you want to be attractive。to women，，you should become
    more authentic？，Does it say，，
- text: if you want to be attractive，to women，。you should become，stronger as a human
    being？，If you want to become，attractive to women，。should you go out，and do the
    things，that would make you，really become a man？，Well，。that would take a long time。，Okay？，That's
    a long time。，How about this？，What if you look like the guy。who you saw on TV？，He
    had a lot of girls。，Isn't that simple？，Isn't that beautifully simple？。Beautifully
    elegant。，Isn't it elegant，that you could go out，and you could just work，a simple。straightforward
    job，that you know。，It's not complex， right？，You just work your job。，Work the job。。With
    the job，，you get the money。，Right？，Who of you's ever seen Scarface？，Okay？，What
    do you get first？，The money。，What do you get second？，What do you get third？，The
    girls， right？，How could you not？。It sounds great。Right？，And it's Scarface。，That
    guy's like，the coolest guy of all time。。And he's telling you this。，So， it's simple。，It's
    straightforward。，You get the money。。And then everything，works out for you。，Become
    like the guy，that you see on TV。，Because you see it。right？，You see that guy on
    TV。，You can see the products he has。，You see the way he looks。。And he's got the
    woman。，He's like，Okay？，He's got the girl。，Boom。，And your unconscious mind，。you
    don't know that you're thinking this。，There's no way that you know，that you're
    thinking it。。But your unconscious mind says，，Oh， that's how you get girls？，Okay，
    cool。，Great。，I can do that。。I can handle that。，That makes sense。，I can piece that
    together，
- text: into my reality。，So。become like the guy，that you see on TV。，See， society has
    in many ways。evolved to maintain social order。，It is designed to give you，a set
    of achievable goals。that you can strive towards and meet。，That's really what it
    is， right？。Society gives you a set of goals， right？，First you go to school。，Then
    you go to high school。。Then college。，Then you get this type of job。，Then you save
    up for your retirement fund。。And then after all is said and done，when you're like
    in your 60s，，you can go retire。。Now it'd be called successful life。，So it sets
    that for you， right？。Society gives you never ending mental stimulation。，Endless
    stimulation， doesn't it？。Society gives you what？，What does it give you？，It gives
    you a magic pill for everything。。It gives you the answer to all your problems。，Because
    the supply，will always meet the demand。。In a good system，，if you have a demand，，some
    kind of supply will come to meet it。，Won't it？。And the system works， right？，The
    system will take care of you。，You can be the spoke in the wheel。。And if you believe
    in the system，，everything will be fine。。That is what the unconscious assumption
    is， okay？，There's no conspiracy about this。。There's not like some guys，sing like
    smoking man，，sing at the table like， you know，，oh yes。we'll make them，，give them
    these little goals。，The little rats race that it is。，It's not like that。。It's
    just the way that it evolves。，No one's responsible for it， okay？，And now we're
    at a point。where not only is， you know，，
- text: the magic pill expected，，it's demanded。，I demand it。。Give me the magic pill。，I
    demand it。，That's what people want。，Isn't it funny when a situation arises。where
    there is no solution to your problems，and people are just outraged， right？。Like
    with Virgin Airlines。，Just outraged。，Because they were part of，，because when you，。because
    when they don't get what they wanted，，you're actually messing with their whole
    belief system。，Because it's saying that the，，you know， you cannot just be brain
    atrophied，and live in the system。and have it take care of you。，Society is in many
    ways a lot like a Hollywood movie。。There is a good guy。，There is a bad guy。，And
    there's an ending，that reinforces social norms。。Isn't it？，Think a lot about that，
    guys。，Classic Hollywood movie。，There's a good guy。。There's a bad guy。，It's real
    simple， right？，It's not confusing。。It's not like actually most people think they're
    good，and everyone has different opinions。and people do stuff to each other they
    forget about，and at the end of the day。just a lot of shit happens。，It's not like
    that。，There's a good guy。，Great Hollywood movie。。There's a good guy。，And there's
    an uplifting message。，Go America at the end。。Saying that the system works， right？，The
    system is good。，For a little while there。we were thinking that our existing beliefs，could
    be wrong。，And those beliefs were threatened。，But no。，At the end we discover that，there
    is a good reason to have those beliefs。。That's your classic Hollywood movie。，
- text: That's the way that it tends to work。。And there's a simplicity there。，A simplicity。，Like
    everyone thinks they're the good guys。。Everyone says， you know， our country is
    good。，This other country is bad。，Right？。Everybody believes that。，Everyone is on
    the side of God。，You know？，God is on our side。。Doesn't matter who you are。，All
    right？，And so the thing is，people like that simplicity。。They don't want to think。，They
    don't want to look，at the multi-dimensions。of the way that the world works。，They
    don't want to have to dig in deep。。They don't want to be required，to have to be
    aware all the time。，They want to just get their beliefs。and then go to sleep，and
    allow those beliefs，to take care of everything。。That is the magic pill society，in
    which we live。，And so what happens。is we believe that there's a product，that can
    solve everything。，If you just go to work。and you make your money，your problems
    with women，will get solved。，How many guys。how many of you in here，have had friends
    that maybe，were studying to become lawyers。or doctors and they said，，well， you
    know，，I can't meet women right now。but I'm just going to focus on studying，because
    once I become a doctor，or a lawyer。I'm going to have it all taken care of。，Who's
    had friends that said that？。That's that belief in the system。，Of course， what's
    going to happen，when that doctor or lawyer。does get an attractive girlfriend，and
    then he's gone for the weekend，and she goes out clubbing。with her friends？，She's
    going to meet，
- text: some other bartender dude，who's going to go take her。behind the dumpster，and
    hook up with her， right？，His sweetheart， you know？，How many of you have had。look，
    how many guys in this room，have either you yourselves，or had friends that hooked
    up。with a girl in a bathroom？，All these guys， right？，Gee， and most of those girls。will
    marry if they're attractive。，A lot of them will marry，lawyer chodes and doctor
    chodes。and all that stuff，who believe in the system。，And they thought that，their
    sweetheart。was the way that she was， right？，So the thing is that，and then you
    think that。her behavior is going to stop，if that guy's not attractive enough，to
    hold her attention？，No。。The behavior will stay consistent。，People's behavior，generally
    is consistent。，So， look。，Exactly。。Yeah。，If you've not figured out，how to meet
    a woman's，emotional needs， you know，。how are you going to，have a relationship，
    right？，How are you going to have，a long-term relationship？。But most people， of
    course，，want to become the guy，that they see on TV。，Can this stuff give you。the
    temporary fix？，Look。，Can this stuff give you，anything beyond，a temporary fix of
    confidence？。Of course not。，Of course not。，You guys remember Fight Club？，What's
    he say？，You are not。You are not what？，What's that？，You are not a special snowflake。，What
    else， guys？。You are not your what？，You are not the contents，of your wallet。，You
    are not what else？。You are not your furnitures。，You are not your fucking khakis。，Right？，And
    that inspired a lot of me。
- text: because to tell you the truth，，when I first…，Well， first I watched the movie，。when
    I was first exposed to that，，wow， you know， I was like…，As I sat there， right？，Like
    in my house。in my car，，and like all this stuff， right？，That I worked so hard to
    get，，I'm like， I'm not。you know， right？，And ooh， isn't that funny？，See， these
    things，，all these superficial things。through the system，cannot inspire confidence
    in you。，They will not inspire，the type of behavior，。characteristics， individuality，that
    is necessary to be really，rockstar level success with women。。That it is not capable
    of doing that。，It is not in its nature，，and it is not possible。that that could
    ever happen。，Ultimately， these things，are hollow and unsatisfying。。Living up to
    other people's standards，can give you a temporary fix，of confidence，。but it will
    not give you，a real sense of value or self-esteem。，Where does real confidence
    come from？。Inside。，Inside， right？，Your sense of identity，，your sense of who you
    are，，your own sense of values，。your own sense of integrity。，That's where that
    kind of stuff comes from。，We're going to explore that。a lot this weekend。，Let's
    play the game of what if。，What if。，Let's think about it。，What would happen。if
    you guys did play the game，of society？，Let's say that you played it，to the hills。。You
    really played it good。，You got the looks。，You got the money。，OK？，You had the respectable
    job。。Everything。，What if？，What if you did that？，What if you went and got，cosmetic
    surgery？。
- text: What if you took steroids？，That's common。，Yeah。，Yeah。，That's the thing。，Yeah。。Confidence
    based on external pillars。，Yeah。，And you know，，the thing is this。。Here's why it
    can never work。，OK？，Here's why it will never，，ever，，ever work。。At least in the
    long term。，By a superficial value system。，All right？，When we think of society。and
    advertising，，we think of the，the value system。，The value system is，the value system。。The
    value system is，the value system。，All right？，When we think of society，and advertising
    in media，。we would call that，a superficial value system。，By a superficial set
    of values，，an attractive girl。is the pinnacle of achievement。，She's as high as
    it gets。，You could be a doctor。who saved thousands of lives。，You traveled Africa。，You
    saved thousands of lives。，You're successful。。All that great stuff。，But at a night
    club，，who's getting in the door first？。The girl faked the miniskirt。，Yeah。，The
    miniskirt， right？，You've got a girl，who's ex-boyfriend。bought her a pair of fake
    breasts。，Right？，She doesn't eat that much，because she does coke。and now she's
    skinny。，But she figured out，how to do her hair nice，and squeeze herself。into a
    skirt and some pumps。，And that girl，will have more value，than you do。，Straight
    up， dudes。。She will。，She will have more value，than you。，If you believe，in the
    superficial value system。。If that's your belief system，that I let society dictate
    to me，what's valuable。，And you believe that。。When you walk up to her，，you're gonna
    feel nervous。，
- text: You're gonna feel like。you're going up with the empty cup，and you're wanting
    her to fill it。，Because you are，。no matter how high you get as a man，，no matter
    how high，，you cannot win this game。，Except maybe。the only exceptions，would be
    someone like maybe，Hugh Hefner，or something like that。，You know。like the rare
    case，that you could beat the game，by starting like，the fucking mansion。where like
    hot girls have to come，to like get discovered and stuff。，Maybe you could beat
    the game。。But this is a game，that is wired，，is rigged against you。，You can't win
    this one。。It doesn't matter what you do。，Play it as long as you want。，Play it
    as hard as you want。。It is rigged against you。，You can't win this game。，The social
    conditioning game。that's got you running，and running and running，and running and
    running。，Good little consumer， right？。You can't win it。，What's the best way，to
    get somebody，if they have 11 pairs of shoes。what's the best way，to get them to
    buy，the 12th pair of shoes？，What's that？，Yeah， like。if you got 11 pairs of shoes，and
    then you're at the store， right？，And you're looking at that。pair number 12，and
    you're looking at it。，Are you buying it，for its utility？，Are you buying it for。what
    could you be buying it for？，Comfort？，Maybe comfort， but you've got，11 pairs of
    shoes。。You didn't get a comfortable，pair of shoes， right？，See， that's the thing，
    right？。So what are you buying it for？，What is the driving force，behind your consumer
    behavior pattern？。You want that little piece，
- text: of self-esteem。，Sure。，Here， look。 It's like this。，Okay。，Pair number 11。。Will
    you buy it？，Can you just do me a favor，and buy it？，Sure。，Okay， here's your self-esteem。，Okay。so
    now you're，walking out tonight， right？，You got a new pair of shoes。，You feel good？，Feels
    good。。Would you guys say it feels good，to have a new pair of shoes？，Feels good，
    huh？，Right？。How long does it feel good for？，When does the novelty run out？，Couple
    weeks？，Fuck you。，Fuck you。。Okay？，You want your self-esteem？，Yeah。，It's right here。，Okay？，Number
    12。，Let's go。，Okay。，Number 12。。You want it？，Okay。，These ones are real expensive。，They're
    nicer than your other ones。，Okay。。All right， here。，Here you go。，Okay， how many？，A
    couple more weeks？，Fuck you。，Okay？，I got it back now。right？，See？，Now you got to
    buy more。，Okay？，You got a nice couch at home？，You do？，Yeah。，Okay。you can have
    it for a bit。，Okay？，Do you have a car？，Yeah。，Is it brand new， used？。I had it for
    a while。，Fuck you。，Okay？，All right？，Okay？，You see what I'm doing here？，Yeah。，Okay。I'd
    actually leave this with you now，to be nice if I need it。，Okay， yeah。，All right。，Okay，
    so。，Okay。so， look。，I'll give it to you at the end of the seminar。，But look。，That's
    what advertising does。。You know？，Because you're like， look。，On one level， it's
    nice to have new clothes， right？，Like。it's nice to have like a nice fresh press
    outfit，and， you know， look good and stuff like that。。I'm not trying to take anything
    away from that。，But has it ever occurred to you。
- text: that maybe you should feel that way all the time？，How counterintuitive is
    that？。That the way that you feel，when you have a nice pair of shoes，or a nice
    haircut or a nice shirt。is how you should feel all the time。，Like， you guys are
    hearing this right now。，And you're like。but why？，Why would I feel that way？，I
    don't have the nice pair of shoes。，Why would I feel that way？。Does anyone here
    know people，that do feel that way about themselves all the time？。At least one
    or two examples。，Just a couple of you。，Yeah， that's great。。I'm glad at least some
    of you do。，I do， you know？，One example。，You guys see Tim in transformations？。He'd
    be an example of that。，You know？，He just shaved his head recently。，He doesn't
    really care。。He said he's sick of using magic mist。，He's sick of all this chode
    magic mist。，So I shaved it。。And that's the thing。，It's like some people just feel
    that way，about themselves all the time。。And you guys can too。，There's nothing
    stopping you。，But see， that's that fabric of consumer culture。that we live in。，And
    we really believe that a lot of this high society stuff，is like a big deal。。Who
    here's ever been to maybe a party，where maybe if you're out in New York。and some
    exclusive party in New York，where maybe some of the people there。are like quote
    unquote old money，or stuff like that。，It's like all classy。。Anyone ever been to
    something like that， right？，And have you ever felt yourselves kind of like in
    a trap。where like maybe you feel like they have something over you？，
- text: Has anyone felt like that？，Yeah。。Think about what that really is。，If your
    parents gave you your money， right？，So what？。Your parents gave you some money。，Okay。，I
    mean， it's nothing to be ashamed of。。If my parents gave me money，，I would use
    that to do all sorts of great things。，You know？，I mean。really， I'd use that to
    really，improve myself and become the person，I'm capable of being。。But the point
    is that，what is that？，It's an anomaly， right？，Like your parents gave you some
    money。。It's an anomaly。，And that's the thing is that，when you carry yourself around。someone
    who's involved in say high society，or something like that，。the inclination is
    to look up to them，even though they've done nothing， right？，But that's that。again，，that's
    that superficial set of values， okay？，Which is completely bizarre， all right？。So
    let's take looks， something like looks。，Say we want to talk genetics here。，First
    of all，。people are born to look different，in order to have genetic variety。because
    genetic variety is necessary，for healthy species。，But second of all，，is the way
    that like。a good-looking man now in say GQ magazine，，does he look the same，as
    a good-looking man in the 60s？。How about the women？，Right？，You guys realize that
    in terms of。what's considered to be good-looking or not，，it's like some douchebag，sitting
    in Italy choosing like。we're going to have skinny models this year。，It's fab。，Muscles
    are out， skinny is in， right？。Or they're like no，，we're gonna pump it up， okay？，
- text: And then like that's what。it gets called the standard of good-looking， okay？，It's
    not even a genetic thing。。It's like weird random advertising people。，I've got
    nothing against them， you know？，They're not like。we're gonna destroy，the self-esteem
    of society。，They're not thinking like that。。They're just trying to be creative。，But
    the point is that，this stuff is dictating。the way that people feel about themselves。，It's
    crazy。，It's insanity。，It's so utterly stupid。。Like I can't even。。。，Like we need
    a new word，that goes beyond stupid，to describe social conditioning。the way that
    most guys，are walking around feeling，about themselves。，Do we have a。。。，What's
    a better。more extreme，word than stupid？，What is it？，Ludicrous， what else？，Retarded，
    okay？。Social conditioning is retarded。，All right， okay？，So that's， you know，，it's
    gotta be up in the head。。So look， your possessions，can be a reflection，of what
    you've done in life。in the sense that if you've，worked hard， something you love，，and
    you have the possessions。that show it，，they can be a reflection of that，and they
    can be for，your own enjoyment。。And I'd recommend that，you guys go out and you
    get yours，because life is short，and that's fine。。But that's for you， all right？，That
    is absolutely for you。，I have an equal level of respect。like I live in Honolulu。，There's
    some people，who literally just live，on the beach。，They have a cheap。，cheap place
    that they live，，a little side job，，and they surf all day。，And they love that。。They
    love to surf。，
- text: And I respect that equally，as someone who builds，their own company。in some
    area that they love。，The point is you're doing，what you love，，whatever that is。。If
    you love to make money，because you love the work，that you're doing，，then go out
    and do it。all right？，If you wanna just chill and surf，，go out and do it。，I don't
    care what you're doing。as long as it's what you wanna do，，and it's not what you're
    doing，to impress somebody else。or to live up to somebody else's standards，that
    you didn't even create。。That's all that I would ask of you，，and I would hope，that
    you would ask，of yourself。，Anyway， look，。we have these drives， okay？，So we have
    drives。，We wanna be light。，We wanna have friends。。We wanna have girls。，All that
    stuff。，These are natural drives。，Natural healthy drives。，We have them，。and they're
    important。，And thank God we have them。，They're really， really important。。And while
    we have these drives，to enhance ourselves，and that they're healthy，。there is that
    other level，that you gotta think about，，which is that。publicizers are aware of
    these drives，，alright？，And they can push these buttons repeatedly。。Politicians
    are aware of these drives。，Propaganda campaigns are aware of these drives。。And
    when you have these drives，，and everyone who knows shit，knows that you have these
    drives，。it's like a set of exposed buttons，that they can just push on，。like you're
    in just a stimulus responder idiot，over and over and over，，just like the，，here，
    this？，No。I'm taking it away。，
- text: And that game is getting played，and played and played and played。。And it keeps
    society going。，Look， you guys might，，I don't like this capitalism stuff， really？。You
    wanna go live in Venezuela，under Hugo Chavez？，You know what I'm saying， right？，So，
    you know。like， it's，，you know， it's not that it's a bad thing。，I mean， we want
    a healthy economy。，You know。right？，I like a healthy economy，as much as everybody
    else。，But at the same time，，what it did to me，。and one thing that's interesting，，I've
    done this rehearsal now，for the Blueprint Decoded。。This is my fifth Blueprint
    Decoded，big seminar that I ran。，I've also taught in boot camp。every weekend。，And
    I've noticed that，whenever I do this first part，。like whenever I come to this
    first section，where I talk about social conditioning，。I have this little，，like
    almost like this tension in my body。and a little bit of an indignant vibe about
    me，and kind of like， oh， oh， like that。。And it's almost like a different vibe
    I have，during this section， the rest of the seminar。。And the reason why，I was
    trying to figure it out，is because of what it did to me。。And I don't want to claim，that
    I'm a victim or anything like that，，because I'm not claiming that。。But did I walk
    around，completely paranoid，the first 20 years of my life。about what other people
    think of me？，Yeah， I did。，That's two decades， dudes。。Two decades that I walked
    around。，Did I walk around doing stupid things。like going up to that girl with
    chocolates，and like， you know，，
- text: and then having a crush on her。and like occupying，，monopolizing all my mental
    energy，for weeks at a time？，Yes。。Did I have a mental breakdown，when my girlfriend
    dumped me in college，，a complete mental breakdown。stripping me six months of my
    life？，Yes。，You know， did I walk around，just like paranoid， like，。just basically，，I
    can remember my sister giving me，，she worked at a sports store。and gave me a pair
    of $200 sunglasses。，And I was too scared，to wear them to school，。because I thought
    that the kids would say，，you're not cool enough，to wear those types of sunglasses，。even
    though it was a gift。，Right？，Did that happen？，Yes。，So the point is， yeah， you
    know，。I do have a little bit of，，I'm kind of pissed off。，Right？，I'm kind of pissed。。And
    I'm not only kind of pissed about it，，but I'm kind of pissed。for what I see it
    doing to other people，，because I don't feel that human beings。are meant to live
    this life。，I don't feel that we're meant，to live like this， you know？，I mean。I
    guess what we're meant to do，，that's pretty hard。，It's pretty hard to say，what
    we're meant to do。or what not meant to do。，We're entering some slippery territory
    there，。but I don't feel that that's an ideal。，And I want to see change。，I want
    to see people living，。you know， authentically。，And this is one of the reasons，why
    I cover this so deeply。，But beyond that。look，，really think about the power，that
    this gives you。，Out in a night club meeting women。，Right？。In a restaurant， wherever
    it is。，
- text: And you've got an entire room。，Because look，。I'm going to tell you straight，，every
    quote unquote guy，that's really successful with women。understands the concept
    that we've，this concept here，that we've talked about，on a very deep level。。And
    he looks through a room，，and he knows that most people there，，what he sees，。kind
    of like Neo in the Matrix， right？，He sees people in fear， right？，Like。what do
    other people think of me？，He sees the people up on，，like the guys up on the death
    row wall。。Huh huh huh， right？，And doing， you know what guys do？，You ever see guys
    that are like。dancing at the club，，but not because they want to，，because they're
    trying to fit in？。So they're kind of like，，like that， right？，And then maybe like，some
    lyric comes on， like，。And I wish I never met her at all。，Right？，Boom， boom， like
    that， okay？，And that's like，。you see this in the night club all the time。，Jeffy
    was telling me about a guy，that the Rihanna song，。Umbrella， came on。，He pulled
    out his umbrella。，He was like， like that。，So， so ridiculous。，So like。so， you know，，and
    you see this， okay？，And you're in the club，，and you know this， right？。You're in
    the restaurant，，or in the mall，，or wherever you are。，And you see these，。this social
    conditioning brainwashing。，On the one end of the continuum，。you have like the
    hardcore stuff，，like the guy's like，，Let me buy you a drink， my dear。。And then
    like， you know，，on the other side of the continuum，，you have like，。maybe not like
    the obvious，chode behaviors，，
- text: but just like the subtle stuff，。like just like that little bit of vibe of，，he's
    operating through，other people's intentions， right？。He's not really himself。，He's
    kind of a，，I don't want to say a zombie，or something，。because that's really extreme，，but
    he's，，he's not him， you know？，What's that？，Yeah， like robot，。like he's just，，he's
    not him， you know？，Yeah， the bored mind， right？，Like， he's just not who，。he's
    not， okay。，My friend Nathan has an expression，，he says，，be who you're meant to
    be。。And he says that whenever he has a，，you know，，an issue，，and he's looking at
    his own behavior，。he says，，Am I being who I'm meant to be？，And if the answer is
    no，，then he'll stop。。And that's the thing is that，，you know，，you've got to be，，you've
    got to be the person。who you're meant to be。，You've got to be acting，through your
    own intentions。。That doesn't mean to be inconsiderate，，because I think someone，that
    acts inconsiderate。in his way is being a dick。，But the point is，，you've got to
    be acting，through your own intentions。。That's where the social，conditioning comes
    in。，People might say，，why do we need to focus。so much on social conditioning？，Why
    do we need to identify，social conditioning？，Why？。And you see a girl，，right？，You
    see that girl，，just a cute girl，，completely harmless。。It's a no-lose situation，by
    going and talking to her。，But at the same time，，there's something that's。holding
    you back。，Maybe you need more money。，Maybe you need to look better。，Maybe if you
    look like。
- text: that cool guy from TV，，you could do it。，But there's something，that's holding
    you back。。And a lot of that is that，social programming，that has gone on，for the
    first several。decades of your life。，Look， people think，accumulating more trendy
    stuff，is the fastest， easiest，。most effective way，of filling the hole，in their
    self-esteem。，What is the best kind，of consumer？。Best consumers。，Dissatisfied。，Mild
    paranoia，about his status。，Like a mild sort of。general buzz of confusion，about
    who he is。，No identity and no values。，Like he does not know。what he wants in life。，He
    just wants，what other people want。，You know， on an even deeper，level。if you want
    to go，even deeper，，television and，professional sports。，It's funny that。I was such
    a fan of hockey，and various other，professional sports。，And when I started。to come
    into my own，with this stuff，，I just naturally found，that I was no longer。as interested
    in pro sports。，I just kind of，lost interest。，I wasn't like rejecting。，I wasn't
    like。fuck pro sports。，But I lost interest。，Now， after sort of，never watching any。pro
    sports for a long time，，I've changed a bit。，Where now I really，enjoy pro sports
    again。。I've changed a bit。，I've changed a bit。，I've changed a bit。，I've changed
    a bit。，I've changed a bit。。I've changed a bit。，And I'm watching it，for the athleticism，and
    for the，incredible level of。skill these guys are bringing。，And I'm a fan of that。，But
    I'm not like， cheering for laundry。as Jerry Seinfeld， would call it。，I'm not so
    much，like that anymore。
- text: ，Why？，Because I identify。with myself。，I don't identify，with the group，as much
    anymore。，But what we have here。is called spectatorism。，We're a spectator culture。，Spectator
    culture，basically means that。we're constantly looking，for other people，to have
    the glory。，We're looking at，movies for the glory。。You know， we watch TV， right？，We're
    a TV watching nation。，What's the average statistics。on television watching？，Six
    hours a day？，God！，You know， how much advertising。you're getting exposed to？，Most
    people。，And not only is that， you know，，let's say it was even。four hours a day，just
    to take it easier。，Even three。，That is a lot of time，being a spectator。when the
    other， you know，，the seven， eight hours，are spent working。，And so essentially。we're
    a spectator nation。，We look at other people。，We don't want，the glory anymore，
    right？。People would rather，watch TV and look，about the natural environment，than
    go into。the natural environment，，which is another reason，why we're also，destroying
    the environment， right？。Because people，，they pollute，because they don't understand，that
    the natural environment，is real。。They've never even seen it。，They don't care about，the
    third world，because they've never，even seen it。okay？，I made a specific point，of
    living in South America，and I see they're real。。I spend a lot of time，in nature
    now。，I'm out in nature，all the time，just hiking around。and especially in Hawaii。，So
    the point is，we're like，the spectator nation， okay？。Just watching and watching，and
    watching。，
- text: Do you guys remember that one，with John Kerry。where that guy got tasered？，Do
    you guys remember that？，A student got tasered。in a free speech discussion，and
    the security comes up，and tasers him。，He's like，，don't tase me， dude。，He just
    gets tased，and everyone just goes，，what do you do？，They go put it on YouTube。，That's
    like。the student form of protest， right？，Like we're not gonna have a rally。，We'll
    just tape it。and put it on YouTube，and blog about how nasty it was。，That's the
    culture， all right？。People stand by，and they watch shit。，They're not taking， you
    know，，they don't live their own lives。。So see， when you see that，like movie style，
    lifestyle，，like the glorious life， like，，travelling。dating beautiful women，， eating
    the food you wanna eat，，meeting the people，that you wanna meet，。having the adventures，that
    you wanna have，，it's so easy to stand there，as a spectator。and watch other people
    do it，than to do it yourself。，It's simpler。It's easier。。They don't want the glory。，It's
    safe。Yeah。，I say， fuck that， okay？，The glory is to be had。。That's what I say。，The
    glory is to be had。，This is your life。，Turn the TV off。。Turn off the web surfing，
    okay？，Turn that shit off。It's garbage。，You can watch it a little bit。。If you have
    a specific show，that you just love，and you look forward to it，，watch it。Great。。But
    the point is，don't waste time or channel surf。，Stop looking at other people。。You
    wanna know something，even more bizarre？，On the boot camps，，I'd say maybe like，。
- text: this is only like a small percentage，，but there's a certain percentage。of
    people that come on boot camps，，not even because they wanna learn，how to pick
    up girls，。but because they actually，just wanna see the stuff，that they read about
    as spectators。，Okay？。We call them super fans。，All right？，And a super fan is like
    a guy，who's like，，I read about，。I read your stuff，and it's amazing，and I'm so
    looking forward，to the boot camps，so I can see it。。And then they see it，and I'll
    show it，and they're like，wow。，And I was like，，do you wanna，，no，no，。I just wanna
    watch you，，you know？，And like they just wanna see it，，right？，Like they wanna see，。especially
    with the publicity，，the increased publicity，，it's even more like that，，where people，。they
    just wanna see it。，People read my blog，，right？，And they'll be reading my blog。and
    they're reading it，，but they have no interest，in taking action。，A lot，，some like
    guy，like，oh，。he's in South America now。，It's like a book，，right？，Like，ooh，，Tyler
    travels South America，。Chapter 12，，you know？，Like，ooh，，Tyler pulls the hot chick，，Chapter
    10，，you know？，Like that，。like it's not them，，it's like they can just，read about
    it，，it seems glorious，，they're not，。they don't want it，，they don't wanna take，a
    piece of it for themselves。，They don't believe it？，Yeah，。it's just too，，it's so
    outside their reality，that they can't，，they can't see that，，you know？。This is
    why I said，I wanna make the life，of your own design。，Okay？，I believe in that。。That's

    guys。我真的很高興大家在這個房間，支持我和這個組織，我無法告訴你我非常欣賞，但你想知道一點，大部分人不喜歡這個，太多的收藏東西，對吧，我不會覺得我會，得到最高的尊敬，不僅如此，但這個社會充滿了。很多商業的嘲諷，我已經嘗試過了，所以我做RSD的時候，我做到了一個點，我想說的就是，我想讓你們看看自己的生活，我到一個點去說，我要繼續做這個，還是我要停止，然後再包起來回家，為什麼。因為我可以做任何其他工作，我可以做很多其他工作，為什麼我做RSD，我問自己，我愛我做的事，我說是，如果我辭職，會是因為我不想別人，看我，還是因為我真的想辭職，我只會因為我會照顧別人，所以我說。我會是這個奇怪的，瘋狂的，不知不覺的，人們覺得奇怪的，我會是這個奇怪的，我會說，我愛我做的事，我做到了這個選擇，不要懷疑，就算我可能會說，做一輩子的自己的決定，我也不會做這個，因為我總是以一個例子來做。所以這個事，不要擔心別人的想法，不要擔心，你看，人生太短了，你記得當你年輕時，你覺得你會長出一百歲嗎，你記得嗎，之後可能你會發現，你只會長到70歲，或者甚至50或60歲，你人生有多快。誰在這裡長出25歲，OK，25年前的時間多快，快，人生就快了，人生就快了，人生就快了，所以做你想要的事，做你想要的事，因為這就是所有的，這就是它，做你想要的事，好嗎，不要想要社交衝突。不要想要任何人想要的事，只要你知道你做的事是好的，你並不想要人家的價值，做你想要的事，你看，當你看到喜歡的女生，發生什麼事，你的心思在她身上，在想她的價值，想想，看見喜歡的女生，我有足夠的價值嗎。是的或不確定，你的心思在做這個，她是否離開了你的團隊，你對她的標準有信心，你對她有足夠的價值嗎，這些東西，你的心思在做這個，如果你以別人的標準去做，你正在尋求別人，去控制你的身分，你正在尋求別人。告訴你你對人的價值，你會永遠短短的走，這是最終的線條，如果你對別人的標準，也會走上去，猜猜看，如果你對別人的標準，也會走上去，你仍然是一個笨蛋，在嘗試著在別人的標準中，活下去，這並不確定，如果你做不到。你仍然是成功的，你仍然從基礎的程度，在你過的日子，反而反對別人的標準，而不是在控制自己的標準，而是把別人的標準，推到自己的標準裡，但我們並不知道，我們是否可以這樣做，我們沒有被訓練。或教導過我們可以這樣做，我們從來沒有知道，說你是一個科技
    geek，你猜猜看，如果你是真正相信，可能是Hot chicks會喜歡，你可能是一名笨蛋，但你擁有著笨蛋，你相信它，可能是女生會喜歡。可能是女生會比較喜歡，你停止在別人的標準中，
- text: 活下去，你只是擁有著笨蛋，但大部分人不會知道，這是一個原因，你看，當你有自己的價值，我之前談過這一點，我會很簡短地說，我所說的一些價值，是像是自我實現。給人們價值，旅行，教育，這些東西，我看到一個漂亮的女生，我看到她，我正在想如何去接觸她，我知道她有這些質素嗎，我對美麗有價值，那也沒問題，她可能有一個價值，她有美麗，她有一個價值，這也是一個很好的開始。但這並不是所有東西，這代表什麼，這代表什麼，我從來沒有擁有過笨蛋，我走上去，我跟她說話，我正在想如何去達到她的標準，她正在想，她正在想我的標準，因為這在交通中，會遇到的，當一個女生去追求，男生的標準。當她去追求，男生的標準，她會更加吸引你，她會感覺到，你正在追求她的標準，當你遇到一個女生，總會有一個很突出的感覺，誰在對誰的價值上反應，你會更堅定，在自己的身份認知，你會更堅定，在自己的身份認知。你會更堅定，在你對自己的價值上反應，你會更堅定，在你對自己的價值上反應，你會更堅定，在你對自己的價值上反應，你會更堅定，在你對自己的價值上反應，你會更堅定，她會Turn
    off，你就說，你你這些氣血。你不要再感受，我代表我需要，服侍挑釁，你存在，來，好，所以我说今晚我会去谈谈这个，让它有趣，这是我做的一个实验，我正在做一个自然的，所以我出去做了最后一件事，我谈谈资金，最后一件事你应该从来都不谈。然后想想，成功了，完全没问题，那天行得很好，为什么，因为发生了，说你讨论了一些书，说你讨论了一些虚伪的书，但你还是有点有趣，你突然，在之前你正在想她想谈的东西，她看到你确定了，如果你是个有趣的人。你感觉很好，她会想要继续谈谈这些东西，她会说，我读过一本书，你喜欢哈利帕特吗，你知道吗，你知道吗，所以现在她正在谈谈你，但很多人在做的是，他们的整个思考过程，是从结构上出现的，因为他们正在反应她的理念。他们正在想让她，去谈谈她的身份，所以很多人不仅是，走上去说，请告诉我自己是谁，告诉我我好，给我一些提示，让我可以进入国家，但不仅如此，他们还在想，跟她的价值生活，说她想听的东西，而女人，不会被那些提醒。有时候她可能会，你可能会跟她谈谈，但在大部分方面，她不会被提醒，而是，回想起高中，有没有人在高中，在高中有没有人，在高中谈谈，一个很受欢迎的女生，然后女生就开始，谈谈一些，你甚至不关心的东西。可能是一些，你不关心的，一些人，而你找到自己，在谈谈那些，你所知道的，有关于那个人的事，就在谈谈，有没有人，在高中谈谈过这些，对，所以看，我记得，我从小就没喝药，没做过，我其实是，我都不喝药。我朋友都不喝药，但我发现，很多朋友都被烧了，所以我不想喝，我记得，有些人，会跟我谈谈，我喝药，我会说，好，那种药，是什么，是芝麻药，这样的，我会假装，我喝药，你知道吗，我会说，你不喝药，就喝药，但别做。因为有人告诉你，我记得，我记得我认为，我真是个混蛋，我就是，你知道吗，对吗，就像15年还是16年，我都知道，我为什么要假装，对吗，我这里的权利，我可能不可能，在15年时，这么说，但这就是，一种想象。所以，基本上，这就是，很多人，在谈话中，有些人，有些人，有些人，在谈话中，在谈话中，在谈话中，在谈话中，在谈话中，都有叫，反而会有，但人家，还有一些人，在谈话上，都
