- text: '# 泰勒 蓝图解码1080P 90FPS典藏版【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：05.核心自信与场景自信下一個原則，在任何社會交流中，一個人對另一個人的反應更多，而另一個人對他們的反應更多，這可能是，最重要的五個最重要的原則，甚至是最重要的，你必須知道，任何社會交流中，有一個人對另一個人的反應更多。而另一個人對他們的反應更多，這是常常的情況，可能是100與0，可能是51與49，可能是50。01與49。9，但某個人對他們的反應更多，除非你是兩個非常聰明的人物，在這情況下可能是，反應有什麼意思。當我們說某個人對你反應有什麼意思，我們來看看一些症狀，你對某個人的反應有什麼意思，女性必須注意，1。
    他們的自然性被你影響，2。 他們對自己的反應有什麼感覺，3。 他們的焦點對你更有影響，4。他們對你對自己的反應有很大的感受，這很重要，你對自己的反應有很大的影響，你對自己的反應有很大的影響，這兩個是兩種大小，1。
    他們感受到，他們感受到有很大的反應，因為他們的自然性。你們知道當你對女性有很大的影響，當她對你做了很大的反應，你會感受到很奇怪的感覺，當她在反應時，她會感受到，另一種，這是另一個大小，她在分析自己的時間和空間，當某個人在反應時。你會覺得這就是反應時的時間嗎，假設女性真的反應了，你會覺得我應該叫她嗎？，我不知道，她會喜歡我嗎？，這是在反應時的時間和空間，你們知道高級人士在升降機，可能會有更多的空間，跟其他人相比。可能在電影院會有空間，如果你覺得另一個人有更多的空間，你會太緊張了，把空間放在空間上，因為你會覺得，我沒有要做這個，這是反應時的時機，某個人在反應時，會反應得更多，其他人會反應得更多，女性是有趣的。為什麼呢？，當女性真的被吸引，當她真的變得不舒服，當她在乎你，她會開始追求你，把空間和時間都放在你身上，像瘋子一樣，但如果她喜歡你，回家後，可能會開始思考，或許不是，但這會影響男性，女性看到男性反應。會擔心空間和時間的問題，這會很嚴重，當你打算打電話給某人，你會問，這不是正確的時間嗎？，我用了空間和時間嗎？，可能你會覺得，自己沒有這麼高的價值，另外，你可能會找到一位朋友，如果需要指導，你會打電話。但你可能不會打電話，因為打電話是一件很重要的事，有時候，這根據朋友關係，你可能會找到一位朋友，但如果是很親密的朋友，你可能會找到一位朋友，但這也沒問題，但有些關係，你會害怕去做，因為你會害怕失去關係。如果是快的，關於貴賓，可能會找到一位朋友，早上的朋友，沒有貴賓，高價值贏了所有人，開玩笑，當然，對，個人貴賓，我總是，我總是想讓人們，感覺好，不想碰到人，這就是我的貴賓，但我告訴你，如果我早上。要打電話給朋友，我會擔心，他們不喜歡我嗎，不會，我不會擔心，我不會因為，我會覺得自己很老套，我會擔心我自己，好
    現在看，當你給人，當你給人，這些反應，做什麼。The point is when you''re having these kinds of reactions
    to people，，you are doing what？。Giving your power away。，Think about that guys。，What
    does it mean？ Think about it。。Let''s even come out with a better word。 Handing
    your power away。，Yup。you are handing your power away。，You''re saying， you know
    what you''re doing？'
- text: ' Think about it。。Look at what you''re doing。，You''re not even actually like。this
    person doesn''t even want you to give your power away。，Like。do you guys like it
    when people are like nervous to call you and like use up your time？。Do you like
    it when people， like other than out of courtesy， of course。。Do you guys like it
    when people are like reacting to you and like giving you higher status？，Right？Nobody
    wants， except like someone very thick in the grips of ego。，You don''t want that。Women
    don''t want you to do that。，Right？ A woman doesn''t want you to be。she doesn''t
    want you to be nervous around her。，She doesn''t want you to give your power away
    to her。。Of course。 But you''ll hand your power away anyway。。And what''s really
    interesting is that when you''re not popular growing up，。and you know you don''t
    have a lot of friends or whatever，。and when you hang out with kids that are popular
    and you give your power away to them，。you think that maybe on some level you feel
    like they like that。，But in reality。everyone wants to hang out with cool， fun，
    interesting people that don''t give their power away。。Everyone would prefer to
    hang out with the charismatic dude that doesn''t do that。。Nobody wants you to
    give your power away。，I think you guys should really think about that。OK？。And
    if the person does want you to give your power away，。that''s probably not a friend
    that you want to have。，So just keep that in mind。。So we''re moving towards the
    idea of core confidence here。，The bartender， the celebrity。'
- text: the party host， all these different people，，what do they have in common？。They
    have people reacting to them。，They have an environment where they know that people
    will react to them。，This is what leads to，and you guys might have heard this on
    the two-hour free audio，。this is what leads to the stereotypes， these funny stereotypes。，For
    example。the Denny's manager that has had sex with 75% of his female staff。OK？。Does
    anyone here have a friend that like manages a restaurant that like hooked up with
    all the girls in the staff？，No。Always a couple in the room。，Isn't it funny，right？。The
    bartender that hooked up with all the super hot bar girls。OK？，Why is that？。What
    kind of interaction is going on in that environment？，Well，let's really think about
    this。Let's magnify it。，In the environment，what you've got？，Say you've got the
    boss。All right？。Let's say that this guy lives in his parents' basement。OK？，A，lives
    in the parents' basement。B。not that good-looking。，C，he drives a beat-up，rust bucket
    car。，What else？Let's make up a character here。，D，he's a burnout。，What's that？He's
    a pimple face。All right？。He's bald。OK？What else？，He's short。OK？He's fat。OK？，What's
    the accomplishing life？，Nothing。You know。he became a Denny's manager。That's what
    he accomplished。All right？OK？，What's that？He has STDs。All right？OK？，He has the
    most STDs of anyone's work。All right？，Now，so，OK，so basically。from a superficial
    level，right？，Like，from a superficial point of view，people are like，no。that guy
    couldn't get girls。，
- text: That guy's got nothing。And logically，a lot，let's face it。a lot of these girls
    that work in restaurants are really physically attractive。，I mean。some of them
    are smoking，right？，And you see these，like，shmurmy guys that have hooked up，like。with
    all these hot girls。，Like，he's just run them through，right？，And you're like，how？How
    is that？。Well，let's look at what the girl is seeing in her environment。，In that
    environment。what does that guy have？Situational confidence。So，what are people
    doing？What's that？。People are reacting to him。Oh，yeah。What else？He's got power。What
    else？Compliance。He has a lot of compliance。Absolutely。What else？，Status。Come on，guys。Think
    of it this way。If he goes to look at people's work，what happens？，How does their，you
    know。he's watching the way that they're working。People are like，oh，oh，oh，oh，right？，Yeah，his
    judgment。You guys hear what he said？People are reacting to the boss's judgment。Leader
    of men，right？。How about his jokes？Yes，his time is more valuable。How about his
    jokes，guys？He does his jokes。Hey。buddy，buddy，right？，Everyone is like，hahaha，right？See？The
    jokes。He's got that in that environment。。Now from the evolution，you remember how
    I said we talk about cavemen and it's kind of weird that we talk about this whole
    caveman thing。Kind of bizarre。，But we look at it to understand what attraction
    is more clearly。So from an evolutionary point of view，the woman is not socially，you
    know，she's not wired to be like。I'm in this restaurant right now，and this is like，
- text: this little bubble doesn't represent the real world。，The woman is not wired
    to understand that the world is a bigger place than Denny's。She's in the moment，right？From
    a moment to moment point of view。if she is seeing those kinds of subcommunications，she's
    going to have a lot of compliance towards that guy。right？，She is going to，you
    know，when they're out drinking after。when they all go out to the bar later and
    they're all having fun and partying and then he just leans in and starts kissing
    her。she's a lot more likely to go along with it。，Because that's the instincts，all
    right？So that is where the situational confidence comes in。But here's the really
    funny thing。Let's imagine that there's a party。Let's imagine that there is an
    awesome party going on。Filled with super models and what not。，And you take Mr。Denny's，okay？He
    drives his beat up car。they won't even park in front of the place。They quickly
    get rid of it，right？And hide it in some corner。And he shows up into that party。。Now
    he does not have his worker bees giving him props。He doesn't know anybody，right？And
    he's sitting there and he's like，oh，what am I going to do？You know，I don't feel
    comfortable here。He's probably not even thinking that。He's probably just like，uh，I'll
    drink beers。Okay。that's what most guys think in those times，right？So he's a good
    drunk。So what's going to happen there？All right。Probably he's not going to do
    so well，right？Because all those behaviors，he's no longer going to go up，you know，
- text: make physical contact。。He might not make jokes as easily because he goes inside
    his head analyzing whether or not the jokes are good enough。He's probably not
    going to be leading people around。He's probably，his voice is going to change。His
    eye contact is going to change。His decisiveness is going to change。He's looking
    to other people。He's not the anchor of the conversations anymore。He's not centered
    himself anymore。He's wanting other people's approval。It's switched，all right？It
    has switched。But let's say。let's play a game。Let's play an imagination game。Let's
    say that there's some other guy there。Even more overweight。，Big fat guy，right？Big
    fat dude。More sloppy looking，you know，just sitting there。He doesn't even know
    anybody either，right？Say it's a pool party。And he's sitting there and he's big
    and fat。And he's splashing around and he's laughing。And he's having a great time。He's
    having the most fun of anybody there。He's just enjoying the moment。He's not letting
    the environment affect him。，At all。He's just loving it。He's completely comfortable
    with who he is。He doesn't mind that he doesn't have a little superficial quality。He
    doesn't care。He doesn't care。Wow，what could that，you know。God forbid he actually
    just likes himself。Maybe there is no logical reason why he likes himself。Maybe
    he just chooses to like himself。Why？What's he got going on？You know，what is it，right？What
    is it？What's causing it？You know，maybe he owns a Fortune 500 company。Who knows，right？
- text: Maybe he has a 13-inch dick。，Right？He knows how to use it，OK？Maybe he was
    the，you know。maybe he's the president of some social club，right？Maybe he，you know，what
    does he have？Oh。maybe he's like a movie producer，right？Or wait，wait，wait，wait，wait，wait，wait。Maybe，maybe。maybe
    he's just a guy。That's it。He's just a fucking dude。And that's it。That's the only
    reason why he does that。，He doesn't need all those little reinforcements。He's
    just maybe having a good time。He could be enjoying himself in that pretentious
    party。He could actually be having fun in that pretentious environment even without，you
    know。his Boy Scout badges on。How could that be？How could that be？Maybe he's just
    a guy。You ever think about that？Did you ever think that there's nothing stopping
    you from going to the hottest club in your city and just owning it and having
    a great time and being the most fun there？，Did you ever think that you could do
    that？Like，you just could。Not for any reason。You could just do it because you're
    just a guy。It's not a funny thing，right？But you see。that's what we call a core
    confidence。It's not a situational confidence。It's called a core confidence。It's
    called I'm gonna have fun and I don't care what you think。I'm gonna have a good
    time。OK？And so look，everyone's reacting to this guy。Everyone wants his approval。Everyone
    feels a bit different than if he wasn't there。，He's not around。He is the life
    of the party。He's outside his head because he has no reason not to be。Everyone's
    reacting to him。
- text: That's it。And look，that's where attraction comes from，alright？Whoever has
    the most people reacting to their approval and is reacting to the lease and return
    will tend to have the most attraction。OK？Think about that，guys。Like，there's a
    lot of different ways we could define attraction。A lot of different angles that
    we could take。But isn't that an interesting one？。We could say whoever has the
    most people reacting to their approval and is the most indifferent about it basically
    is the most attractive person there。right？And we could probably come up with some
    counter examples and different definitions for attraction。But it's an interesting
    working definition。，I think it's definitely like why a singer would have lots
    of attraction。Singers have an amazing amount of attraction。I know guys that are
    singers in B-class groups like that you've never heard of that have women lined
    up outside their dressing room waiting to party right after all the time。you know？Like
    no-name guys and stuff and just the women enjoy it。They like guys that can just
    express themselves。They like，because look，as a girl。why would she be attracted
    to a guy？Like，why would she be attracted to a singer？He goes up，you know。he actually
    believes in his own standards。Like，when you play music，man。you're putting yourself
    out there，right？You're really putting yourself out there。You're taking your。creative
    vision of that music and you're gonna go up there and you're gonna express that
    and not care what any。I mean，maybe，
- text: you know，probably you care what people think on some level，but you obviously，you
    know。you're able to side-step that enough to go up and express yourself freely。And
    you're fun and you're doing what you want and you're not the same old stiff，right？And
    women just。and then women see all the people reacting to that and it's just incredibly，incredibly
    attractive。Maybe not to all women but to a lot。Some women might say，well，I'm not
    attracted to that。but they're not gonna say they don't have friends that are，right？And，so
    look。I guess what it comes down to is core confidence versus situational confidence，alright？And
    having a core value。Think about what that really means，right？Like。having core
    value as opposed to situational value。Like，isn't that，that's kind of an interesting
    one。alright？Stop and ponder that for a minute。It's one of the things that。I want
    to say is you should have core confidence，right？Why should you have core confidence？It's
    actually really simple。It's a really simple answer。The reason that you should
    have core confidence is because if you just have confidence in all situations。people
    will buy into it。That's it，right？It's just a simple，it's like you get the glitch。Like，oh。there's
    a glitch。If I just act like a rock star，I get treated like a rock star。Cool，right？So
    on one level of like core confidence is people who recognize the glitch。Do you
    remember how I talked earlier？Like，you know，we led into this with social conditioning。We
    led into，
- text: ' this conversation about how most people walk through life in a trance，in
    a walking days。And when you have like core confidence is almost like，you know，you
    recognize the glitch。that that''s how most people are walking around。And if you
    just appear a little bit more confident。you know，you''re going to control the
    situation。You''re going to have the dominant reality。But like when you think about
    core value，we''re almost having to dig a little bit deeper because you actually
    have to。do you remember how I said earlier？Like，you have to make that piece into
    your reality。Like。you have to have like the puzzle there that kind，of goes click
    in your reality。Like，yes。I have core value。Because I bet you look，if I were to
    say who here has core value。I bet you that like everyone in the room，like in a
    sort of like a positive way would be I have core value。You know，I recognize that
    I have core，or sorry，core confidence，right？Now if I say，look。why do you have，so
    if you have core confidence，would you have core value？Everyone would go，yeah。I
    have core value。I''d say why。And they''d go，uh，because I''m me or，uh，you know，because
    I deserve it。like L''Oreal or something，L''Oreal commercial。You know what I mean，right？Like，there''s
    no，like，。and that''s the thing。So，on one level you can get the glitch。like you
    can see the glitch as there of why you should have core confidence。And I think
    most of us get that，you know，like most of us get there is a glitch that you can
    just sort of if you just。you know，put it on，'
- text: you can get it。But I think to be that guy that really pulls。like that guy
    that has like the real sexual abundance that really pulls，that really，really，really。really
    gets it，that really gets results，you have to have that click in your reality where
    it has clicked in your head that you really do have a core value。alright？You have
    to，and a lot of this seminar over the next few days is gonna be like how to create
    that click and we'll go into that further。，But I mean even just on a surface level
    that we could even just cover right now based on what you guys know now。，You could
    even just say look， everyone enjoys a good vibe， right？。Everyone enjoys a great
    vibe around them。，And if you're just a person that's having fun。that's valuable，
    right？，If you're a person that can express yourself freely， that's valuable。。And
    you're offering value to the situation。，We're all human beings。Everyone appreciates
    a personal connection。，Everybody appreciates fun。Everyone appreciates a good vibe。，So
    the point is， you know， just knowing that。why would you ever go out to some quote
    unquote pretentious party，，which by the way。most people call it a pretentious
    party or just feeling bad they don't know how to fit in， right？。It's really true
    because a lot of pretentious parties， there's a lot of cool people there。。But
    regardless， when you just simply know that by， you know， your personality alone
    is enough，。you can give yourself permission to act in the way that you know is
    attractive， all right？。
- text: And I guess the way that I would wrap this up would be to say this。，To me，
    there's an ideal。There's an ideal to all of this。，And， you know， like I started
    off in the seminar where I said。you know， you start off just kind of wanting to
    get a girlfriend or whatever，，and then， you know。your desires and your motivations
    evolve。，Well， one of my evolved desires was to just be able to go into any environment
    and be that same guy。I want a consistency， all right？，I didn't want to be the
    guy where， you know。if I went to that one club where everyone knew me， I felt
    okay。。But then if I went to some foreign club where I didn't feel like I fit in。I
    couldn't be that same guy。That drove me nuts。，I wanted to be able to go without
    my friends。without the shield of having my wingmen there， on my own， if I want，
    you know， if that was。you know，，I'd love to go out with my friends， but the point
    is I don't want to have to go out with my friends。you know？，Like I don't want
    to be like Friday night if like my buddies don't want to go out。like I just don't
    go out， you know？，And so the point is say that I'm traveling， right？。Say I want
    to go travel around and bounce around the planet on my own for a bit。I don't want
    to have to rely on having anyone there。，I'd love to have people there。and if they're
    there， that's great， but I don't want it to be an absolute necessity。，So look，
    to me。when I feel like I hit， I kind of tell the story a lot。
- text: but basically when I hit a certain level where I knew that I was kind of like
    going the direction that I wanted。，I remember I was on a flight that had to stop
    over in Dallas， Texas。and we were stopping there and pulling in， and they said，
    oh， you know。there might be a flight delay。，And I went， oh， damn， I've never been
    to Dallas。I'd love to go there。Maybe I'll go out tonight on my own， right？，And
    I was like， huh， yeah， I like that。That's cool。you know？I can go out on my own
    in some brand new city and go have an adventure。。I'm sure I'll make friends。I'm
    pretty darn sure I'll meet a girl。and it'll probably some interesting things will
    happen， you know， right？，So and I can do that。you know？I can go out on my own
    into some new environment and meet new people。and it's not an issue anymore， right？，Maybe，
    you know， at that point。I might not have been the most potent that I could be
    in a pick up。but I'd reach a level where I was really confident to go into any
    environment and be the person that I was meant to be。all right？，So that to me
    is the core confidence， all right？Because look， living here in Los Angeles。you
    are going to see some of the most extreme cases of situational confidence that
    you will see anywhere in the world。aren't you？，You're going to see people that
    have incredible， you're laughing， right？Because it's so true， right？You will see
    people who have incredible amounts of social influence within their bubble。，Take
    them out of their bubble，
- text: ' and they''re just a couple of fucking oldsters sitting up on the bar with
    their drinks pressed against their chest。，But in their environment， they''re like
    gods， all right？Because they， you know。maybe they''re promoters， maybe they''re
    rich people， you know， whatever it is， right？Maybe they''ve got status。And that''s
    the thing， right？，And those people think of living like that。where on one level
    you know that you have all the status。but take you out of your environment and
    you can''t be that guy anymore。You''re not that guy anymore。。And I''ve met people
    who are in that kind of situation， like， you know。when I''ve had wealthy guys
    come take the boot camp， and they''ll say over and over， oh， man。you should see
    me back in my hometown。I own that place， blah， blah， blah。I own that place。。And
    I can recognize that because I think， damn， you know， and I bet you they do， like，
    seriously。。Like， and I''ve had， I''ve had， if you''re an ex-client of mine。you''re
    not the only one that said I''ve heard it from countless。I just want to say that，
    guys。，So。like， no， but really， like， I''ve had countless， you know。wealthy or
    popular people come through the program， and they say。they tend to say the exact
    same thing。，They''ll go in there and they''ll keep saying， man。you have no idea
    how much I own it at home。I don''t need to do this。I don''t need to deal with
    this。Because they don''t， they just don''t know the ropes， right？They''re still
    learning the ropes。。And usually， like，'
- text: ' the biggest epiphany that I''m trying to create if I''m dealing with a very，
    like。you know， wealthy client is I''m always， the biggest epiphany that I try
    to create for any of them is。dude， you don''t need those shields。Come on。You don''t
    fucking need it。All right？，Drop them。Drop the personality shells。Put yourself
    on the line。Either make it， float or sink on your own feet。man。You know what I''m
    saying？Like， get the girl or not， but get it because of you。Don''t get it because
    of this other shit。，You get her， you get her， you don''t， you don''t。but get her
    based on yourself。At least then you know you put your personality out there。At
    least you know that you， you know that you had integrity。that you know you had
    that authenticity about you。，Because you know what？Isn''t it funny that when all
    things are created equal。the social environment is kind of like the great equalizer
    when you take out all that bullshit。Like。for example， say that you''re out with
    your friends from work， right？。Some of you guys here who might be studying this
    stuff have incredible social skills now。but you might have some boss at work that
    has all the status。You go out to the bar with your boss。the great equalizer happens，
    right？，Because now you''re out there having a great time and he''s like。oh， oh，
    yo， there goes Joe。He''s so crazy。You''re crazy。Yeah， you''re crazy， Joe， right？And
    they just sit there， then they''re not able to talk to people in the bar。。And
    then they make excuses about it， right？'
- text: I've seen some guys nodding here because they've had that。right？You know，
    oh， you're just nuts， man， right？，Because they got taken out of their environment。you
    know？I say forget all that stuff， okay？I say let's evolve past that。Let's not
    worry about any form of personality shell or situational based confidence。Let's
    find confidence from the core。Let's find confidence from the value that you offer
    as a human being。，And look， this isn't some feel good shit， all right？I would
    hope it feels good and I would hope it's uplifting， but you want to know something？The
    guys that have this down are getting laid more and buy hotter girls and have better
    girlfriends than the guys that don't。Straight up， you know？，So on one level it's
    like uplifting and heartwarming and all that stuff。but on another level it's just
    fucking potent。It's just badass， you know？Having core confidence is just a badass
    thing to have。And that's why I want you guys to be able to develop that。Rather
    than developing a prison。develop freedom for yourself and develop authenticity。，All
    right， so look。we're gonna wrap up today on an interesting topic。Like I said，
    today we're laying down a foundation。all right？Wax on， wax off。What that means
    is we're recovering the foundations and going deeper and deeper with each section。Look，
    we're gonna talk about a very interesting topic。a topic a lot of people avoided
    and a topic that I would like to talk about myself。which is that of love， all
    right？The word love，
- text: ' the concept of love。and where this fits into your own life。Now isn''t that
    an interesting thing？Because you see。we''re gonna talk about that in this talk。It''s
    a very interesting topic。。Now isn''t that an interesting thing？Because in this
    community， we generally shy away from that。right？We don''t really talk about that。It''s
    funny， because we come into this。And one of the major reasons that most people
    are in this room is that at one point we felt as though we''re in love。fell in
    love with a girl， and started looking for information。What''s the first thing
    that you learn when you find this stuff？Basic premise。if you want to be successful，，with
    one particular girl，learn to be successful with women in general。What does that
    mean？It means you get out of that model of the world where every girl that you
    meet that you like。you''re falling in love with。Is that interesting？So we get
    away from that。In a lot of ways。one of the reasons why this community can at times
    come across as misogynistic is because even though the guys that are in it probably
    are more。you know， loving type guys， if anything， so loving that they can send
    women running away from them。nonetheless， we sort of disconnect with that part
    of ourselves。，How do most of us wind up here？How do most of us get into this？Here''s
    the classic case。The classic case that I see works like this。You have a girlfriend。You''re
    with her， right？And you''re together。Everything is great。Suddenly you find out
    that maybe she cheated on you， right？'
- text: Or maybe she just dumped you。Maybe she just broke up with you because she
    was no longer attracted。Maybe you choded yourself out。as it's so commonly done。So
    what happens？Well， first of all，， here's the shocking part。The most shocking part
    of losing your girl， in my opinion， is that the girl that you love。the girl that
    you were so connected to changes， right？That person no longer exists， right？This
    girl who is so sweet with you， that said certain things， that made certain promises。she
    no longer exists。And this is a very powerful thing， right？Like what happens？Because
    it's not。just like where does she go？And maybe you still love that girl， right？Like
    you still have all those emotions。You still have all those feelings。But there's
    just these new negative feelings。So my friend Chris said to me when his wife left
    him。is that he still loves his wife， but there's all of these new negative feelings
    that are mixed in。And it's like you want to still feel those emotions。You want
    to still feel that。But there's like this like， it's almost like you're like going
    into like your love program， like， oh。oh， oh， oh， oh， she's so lovely， oh， oh，
    oh， oh， you know？Because then you remember。And you want it back， right？，You want
    those feelings to come back。You're not thinking， oh， you know。I need to disconnect
    myself from those feelings and pull myself together as a man and， you know。start
    living in abundance。You don't want that。Let's face it。When you've lost that girl。all
    that you want，
- text: ' let''s face it， is you just want her back， right？That''s what you want。You
    don''t want to learn how to be a big pimp。You don''t want to learn how to live
    in abundance with women。You don''t want to go have to approach people。You don''t
    want any of that。If you do it， if anything。you''re just thinking that you''ll
    get your girl back by doing this， you know， right？Like I''ll learn how to be a
    good girl。，I''ll learn how to get these other girls and get her back like Return
    of the Jedi。all right？Okay？Face my father， right？You know？And so， and it''s a
    funny thing， right？And isn''t it amazing how we all have different faces？Like
    we have different faces and personalities for different people that we meet。Like
    the way that we might treat， you know， a homeless beggar who''s being really pushy
    might be different than how we treat our mothers。And the way that we treat， you
    know， a girl that we care about could be different than the way that we treat
    a friend and so on and so forth。There''s all these different faces。And when you''re
    with， that girl。the face that she gives you is like this， you know， the couple
    face， right？Like it''s like looking into a mirror and seeing the most beautiful
    reflection in the world back of love and she loves you and all that kind of stuff。And
    you can lie in bed。My friend Timmy calls it the cherishing， right？And that''s
    true。He''s like the cherish， the cherish， right？And， you know， he kind of teases
    it like that。But the thing is that is what， you know，'
- text: ' that''s what''s taking place。Now isn''t it funny that when you lose that，
    you want to get it back， right？Like。and that''s the classic thing。I''m gonna win
    her back。You think you''re gonna win her back。So what happens in the classic case？The
    guy goes。He resolves he''s gonna win her back。Why？Because he probably saw it on
    some Hollywood movie of social conditioning， right？And it can drive some nuts
    because he says it''s like the same girl。Here''s the biggest mind screw of it
    all。The same special places that you went with the girl。like say that she took
    you to like her favorite place or you took her to your favorite place。she will
    go do， all these things with the next guy probably。You know what I''m saying，
    right？You know the special spot where you first cherished and made love？She''ll
    go there with the dude。right？Why？Because that''s what she knows， right？You know
    like that nice dress that you bought her so she could look really good for when
    you went out？She''s gonna wear that if it''s her best dress with this guy。How
    is she not， right？I mean not all girls do that and different girls do different
    things。But the guys do the same thing too。，Maybe you gave her a gift and she actually
    re-gifted， right？And gave it， you know？And you think how？How could she be doing
    this？And she said， and see。here was the funny thing。Do you remember how we talked
    about different focuses？And how we each focus。We have different ways that we remember
    any different relationship。'
- text: We have different ways that we remember friendships。And different things that
    we focus on。And when she goes to that other guy， when she leaves you， all the
    nice things that you guys had。because you had these nice things together。Like
    you had， you know， when you first met。。And your quirky story of how you first
    met。You know？And you have like your cool story of why you're together。Like have
    you guys noticed that in a relationship？You'll often times continually re-verbalize。re-confirm
    why you're together。Have you guys ever seen that？Right？Like you're always like，
    yeah。because we have this thing。It's our thing， right？You have your thing with
    the girl， okay？And you know， you have like， you know， why you continue to be together。Or
    why you're together and you have a special bond that you couldn't get elsewhere。That's
    the。I think that's actually the big one， huh？Is that it？，Is that the big one？You
    have this special bond with the girl that you have some qualities。She keeps re-affirming
    to you that she couldn't get anywhere else。So when she leaves you。it's so confusing。And
    especially because look，what is the number one trance inducing way to really feel
    the emotions of love with someone。you know，without any constriction or being stifled。Just
    to really unstifle those feelings of love。What's the key word about love？It starts
    with an F。The key word to put yourself in a， deep trance。What is a diamond？Forever。Right？I
    will love you forever。Okay？This is love，right？And the forever idea of it。
- text: And so you have your quirky thing。And you think，but she said forever。right？And
    that's how I felt when my girlfriend dumped me。Like 21 years old，she was 19。She
    had full right to break up with me，right？She had full right to go and see what
    else is out there。I don't，of course，I was being highly young，you know，just being
    a young guy。But the point is，is。that I was like，how，right？This was forever。You
    know，this was，you know，this is our thing。And I have these qualities。You can't
    get that from somebody else。You can't get that from him。You can't get that，you
    know。Then she's going out wearing the clothes you bought her。going to your places。And
    it is the mind screw of mind screws。And virtually every guy in this room has been
    through it。And virtually every guy watching these DVDs at home has been through
    it。At one point。everyone goes through this。It's a growing phase，right？Like it's
    part of growing up。And you know what？，I don't think any of us would take it back，right？Like
    you wouldn't take back your experiences。It's part of what makes you who you are。It's
    just part of growing up，right？And you know。it makes you wonder，like what is love，right？I
    mean，if it's fragile like that。if those kinds of things can happen，where does
    this fit into your life，right？And some people。of course，become jaded，right？They're
    like，fuck it，you know？I'm done。I'm never gonna have a girlfriend。I'm gonna play
    the field。I'm not gonna get screwed over，blah，blah。blah。You know，you get stuff
    like that。They just， need it，
- text: right？Like probably everyone here knows someone who will fall in love with
    any attractive girl that will have them。right？If she's attractive，oh，I'm in love，oh，god，we
    cherish，ba，right？And they do that all the time。okay？And there's like a virus，sure，yeah。And
    there's different ends of the continuum here。But what is love，right？And let's
    think about it。Like what are the different。like when we think about love，what
    are the different definitions？Like is love two teenagers in the back of a car
    scrambling for a condom？，Right？Okay？Right？It can't be，at the time，right？So，you
    know，is love，you know。a pair of newlyweds on the first night of their wedding？Is
    love an old couple sitting on the couch？They haven't had sex in 20 years but they're
    deeply in love，right？Because it don't work no more。right？But，okay？You know？You
    know？Yeah，plum is broken。But like，you know，what is it，right？And what's interesting
    is that English，as a language，in many ways，，dictates our concept of reality。The
    language that you speak dictates the emotions that you feel and the experience
    of the world that you have。And so see，in most cultures，or I don't know if it's
    in most，but I know in many languages。there's many different words for love，alright？You
    have brotherly love。You have love for a father。love for a mother。Then you have
    infatuation。And then you have like，you know，long-term love，you know。things like
    that。And when you break those up and you don't have this all-encompassing word
    that's supposed to mean everything。
- text: then the self-hypnosis，，is not so common。But understand that。And understand
    that more than anything。love is a self-hypnosis，alright？A lot of people conceive
    of love as having supernatural properties。They might think that everyone has one
    perfect soulmate。They might think that love lasts forever or true love lasts forever。They
    might think that you can only fall in love a certain number of times in your life。。One
    person on the forum recently kept saying that the first love is the best。so he
    was going to keep trying to get back his first love。Very bizarre。Really bizarre。That's
    what your mom says，right？Okay。People might believe that fate will handle love
    for them，right？Like you shouldn't try to meet someone。Like I mean，if that was
    true。then me and my girlfriend certainly wouldn't be a good item because I did
    a lot of very active。deliberate things to land myself in the situation I'm in
    right now，right？But they think，no。it'll just happen。Fate will take care of it。，And
    you know what？With those kind of belief systems。that there's these powerful forces
    at work，it is no wonder that people self-hypnotize themselves into all sorts of
    wacky beliefs and to a lot of emotional pain。you know？And to a lot of unpleasant
    experiences，alright？Is love a feeling of attraction。a feeling of connection，a
    feeling of lust，a feeling of physical attachment，maybe underlying oneness？What
    is it？What does it mean to you？Is it anxious co-dependence？Isn't that a funny
    one？。Like look at that one。
- text: That is a funny one。Mistaking neediness for love。Here's what is to be understood。Love
    is not caused by another person。It's a self-hypnosis，alright？It's a trance that
    you put yourself in。It's caused by yourself。It's not something caused by another
    person，caused by ourselves。And as we loop our thoughts over and over around a
    concept of a particular person。our mind shifts the way that we perceive it。，And
    suddenly everything makes sense。It's love，alright？And as it takes hold into your
    psyche，your physical body follows suit。spinning and intensifying your emotions
    until you are fully enraptured。That is what love will do to you。It will take a
    concept of a person and will make them into something they're not and can even
    make them into an object to you if you're not doing it in a healthy way。So the
    thing is that，understand that，like your concept，your，girlfriend。that's a concept
    that you have。But at the same time，that may not be who she is as a person。So let's
    make this even more clear。Why don't we draw a distinction almost between like
    the chode version of love and like what love becomes to you when you've been in
    this for a long time。okay？To a chode，he is walking around with a gap in the self-esteem。And
    so，when he finds that woman。that little gap gets a plug in it for a temporary
    period of time。And he feels what a cool guy would call normal。That's the emotions
    that he's feeling。that good feeling in your body that you have。And you're a good
    guy。
- text: that good feeling that you have in your body。That is what you're experiencing
    if you're a chode and you're getting a bit of validation。alright？You're getting
    a taste of validation。And then of course the language does its work。spins its
    effects on you，and then you think that you're in love with that person。。Many times
    that can be codependence。You see，look，that good feeling that you have in your
    body。like that really good feeling of being you，is something that you should be
    able to self-generate。It's something that comes from within yourself，alright？And
    when you love somebody，maybe，you know。that's like that personal connection that
    you create with that person，and it can fuel it even more。But anytime that you
    lose that other person out of your life。that good feeling should not be going
    away。，You know what I'm saying？Like。it's okay to experience loss and to go through
    the healthy，you know。cathartic experience of experiencing loss。But beyond that
    is we're going into unhealthy land where a lot of guys are stuck。alright？Because
    essentially what's happened is they are disconnected from their self-esteem。They
    use the girl as a pillar in a new sense of reality。Remember how we talked about
    situational confidence and how when you have certain situations you feel better
    about yourself and more confidence？，Well，a lot of guys use a woman that they have
    as a sort of form of situational confidence。and when they lose that woman，their
    mojo is taken away from them and they feel lost。
- text: The house of cards crumbles。That's what's going on，alright？Here's another
    fact。You don't know somebody until you've been with them a long time。I'm sorry。Sorry
    to tell that to you。And from a certain perspective，you could call that love at
    first sight，right？You could say，you know。love at first sight。Of course，it was
    love at first sight。，But the point is that，you know。you could call that like love
    at first sight，right？And because it worked out，you know。because the longevity
    was there，because I was able to maintain the multiple several year relationship
    now being together for over three years。But the thing is that with，you know，in
    reality，I wasn't coming from a position of， lack，right？I wasn't coming with an
    empty cup looking to be filled or looking to be completed，alright？So there was
    the offering of value that was there。And she's a really high self-esteem person。so
    it was like a，you know，fueling fire。It wasn't like this sort of weird co-dependence
    or anything like that。And I guess you could say beyond that，you know，a lot of
    guys don't realize what a relationship really is or what it means to get involved
    with somebody。I mean，look，when you get involved with somebody，you're taking on
    all their。problems as your own in a lot of ways，right？When you get deeply involved。I
    mean，you know。you're getting involved with their parents，their family life。If
    she has，you know。I have a friend whose girlfriend got cervical cancer and he had
    to go through that whole thing with her。
- text: I've had friends whose girlfriend is broke and I have to financially support
    them。Health issues。family issues。You don't just pick a hot chick and fall in love，okay？You
    know what I'm saying？You don't just，you don't know her。You think that you can
    tell if she，for example。if she's someone who's highly prone， towards deceit。you
    don't know if a girl is telling you the truth about herself or not。You have no
    way of knowing。Do you think that you're the hearty boys，right？And that you can
    tell and that you can know a girl just by immediately like just getting to know
    her？No。Look，if it works out，it works out and that's great and that's what you
    want。But the point is you don't just fall in love with any person，okay？You get
    to know them。And this is where a lot of guys go wrong though because here's what
    happens。When you meet a girl in a club，it is so nice。Like，say out at a nightclub。say
    it during the day and you have an incredible connection。，Like，look，you're meeting
    the girl。you know，you're the man，you're the big pimp，she's really into you，she
    compliments you。maybe you make out，you're sitting there，you're stroking your hair，that
    kind of stuff。And you've got a chemical eruption going on，man。It is addictive。It
    is。could be easily the most addictive feeling in the world，alright？It is amazing。And
    when you feel that。one way to intensify it is to think you really have a connection
    with this girl。But what tends to happen is this。When the girl sees you as the
    abundance-minded， guy，right？
- text: She sees you as the cool，non-outcome dependent，non-reaction seeking。not attached
    to any kind of result，you're attractive。And so she has one type of personality
    towards you。And that's the personality that you're getting to know。That's the
    personality that you know。You're getting to know her，I'm with a hot guy personality。But
    then what happens is as you're being nice to her and then you start to feel those
    good emotions。you feel attached。Because you're like，we're on the same team now，we're
    on the same team。。And then suddenly what happens is you start to choke yourself
    out，right？Because you become attached to the outcome。Now she says she has to go
    to the bathroom and that same fucking cool guy that was all like。yeah，yeah，you
    know，like when you first met。Now all of a sudden it's like，oh，she coming back，oh。she
    coming back。And you're feeling that loss。You're feeling like that，those chemicals
    in your body。like where is she？And you're going，where is she，where is she at，right？Because
    you want her。Then you see her，maybe as she comes out of the bathroom，she starts
    talking to some other guy，right？Do you man up and go in there and yank her out？No，of
    course not。You're， the chemicals in your body。you can feel that kind of like that。You
    feel yourself being deflated。You can feel yourself losing state，all right？We're
    going to talk。state is going to be a huge theme of tomorrow。You feel yourself
    falling out of state。losing your mojo，you know，losing the nimbus is dimming as
    they would call it，
- text: all right？We'll talk more about that later，don't worry about it。So look。what
    happens is your concept of what love is and wanting to fall in love is actually
    interfering with the process of make。of finding that great girl。Because the truth
    is she may like you when you're acting attractive，。but as soon as you stop acting
    that way and you become outcome dependent。it's now a new sort of thing。What does
    that mean？Does that mean never fall in love？Of course not。But what that means
    is this，you're a man of standards。You have to be a man of standards。And you can
    be getting to know a girl and you can have incredible，you know。connection with
    her and feel good and enjoy it。But you remember how I talked about paradoxical
    things like on one level you know what people are like and another level you enjoy
    them and think the best？The same concept applies here。You can feel good，you can
    bath and bathe in the emotions and bask in them and enjoy them。But at the same
    time，you can't， be losing state as you start to，you know。if the attraction starts
    to flicker out。And I see this is a huge sticking point。I see this is a huge sticking
    point between guys and reaching a mastery type of level，okay？Like on an advanced
    level here。Where what happens is they're very good in the field。but when they
    start to get in with the girl，they become outcome dependent about halfway through
    the interaction because they're feeling those emotions。And they wind up losing
    the girl。And believe me，
- text: that's a painful way to lose a girl。Sucks。So how do we move past this？You
    know what I'm saying？How do we move， past that kind of a mindset。that kind of
    approach，that kind of way of coming out，this sort of thing？Again。you have to know
    that you do not know somebody until you know them。Don't make judgments。Don't make
    assumptions。Don't assume anything about the girl。Look。this girl might be seeing
    five different guys and she's going to continue seeing them even when she's with
    you。Even though she's telling you she loves you and you've got the biggest cock
    ever and whatever she's telling you。okay？It doesn't really matter。She could be
    seeing other guys。She might have countless orbiters that are driving her around。。And
    stuff like that and doing favors for her and every so often she does a favor for
    them back。All right？You don't know what the girl is like，right？She might be a
    liar。She might be deceitful。She might be needy。Have you ever thought of that one？You
    guys might think，see。any of you guys are coming from a position of scarcity，I
    know what you're thinking。You want a needy girlfriend。That's what you want。From
    scarcity，I said。If you're coming from a position of scarcity，you want the needy
    girlfriend。You're like。I want the girl that's calling me。I want the girl that
    can't get enough of me。But when you start coming from an abundance position，you
    get what the reaction is like。。The reaction that you just heard here，which is，blah，blah，right？
- text: You can't even get it to work when the girl is needy。Anyone ever had that
    experience？Like you're dating a cute girl and then she gets needy and no worky，no
    worky worky anymore。Right？Done。Just get away。Blah，gross，ugh，right？I don't know
    if maybe that's just like when you've moved past neediness yourself。it almost
    becomes your shadow。Like you。Yeah，yeah，yeah，you start being the flag，right？But
    like the thing is，you're not， the only thing is like when you work so hard not
    to become needy and then you see that behavior。in a lot of ways it can mess with
    your head because you're like，that's the old me，ugh，right？You can feel that way。In
    a certain way，I also think that you，you know，being in a relationship。you do have
    to tolerate a level of neediness from the girl because，you know。when a girl really
    likes you，she is going to just act on her emotions and that can be a sticking
    point too。But point being，look，you don't know the girl，alright？So assume nothing。Enjoy
    the experience。Enjoy the emotions but don't be attached。Do you guys understand
    what enjoyment。without attachment means？Enjoy the experience fully。to the fullest
    extent but don't have any attachment because believe me。that same girl that was
    one way，as soon as she sees that you're attached to the outcome。will transform
    right before your very eyes to a different person，alright？The outcome。like I want
    to be with this girl now，we're going to be together，blah，blah，okay？
- text: And I think being attached to the outcome of sex can be a negative thing。I
    also think being attached to how， having a relationship after sex can be a negative
    thing。I think being attached to just getting the extraction of the phone number
    during the first club meeting or whatever can be tough。Again，paradoxical views。On
    one side，we have like，you know，like as Ozzy would say，close，man。just close，right？You
    know，go fucking close。No，I need some report。No，close，right？On the other side。we
    have the，you know，non-outcome dependence and it's two paradoxical concepts。You
    have to have a good handle on both of them。Anyway，，I mean。I guess the way that
    I would wrap it up is like this。Love is something that you experience within yourself，alright？It's
    something that you experience when you're walking down the street。It's something
    that you experience when you're talking to a friend。It's something that you experience
    when you look at the sky。I swear to God，man。And this is kind of a funny thing。I
    think people honestly，I think。think I might be kidding when I say this，but to
    become a really，really good at picking up chicks。like this is kind of funny，to
    be amazing at picking up chicks，，you've got to get that。almost like that spiritual
    side of yourself handled，alright？And that sounds kind of funny，right？Like to mack
    the hose，okay？You know，you've got to get that，like。you've got to get almost like
    your relationship with God handled，you know what I'm saying，right？And when I say
    that，by the way，
- text: that doesn't necessarily even mean any type of religion or anything like that。but
    when I say that，I almost mean like your place in the world，right？Even as an atheist，right？Like。whatever
    your beliefs are，you have to be able to， have that，like。that good feeling independently
    about the world，like，that the world is a good place。that the world is a place
    where you're at home，a world is a place that's beautiful，you know？And when you
    can experience that，you become a person who is independently happy。and independently
    validated，and independently amused，and suddenly，and isn't that funny。the funny
    paradox of it，suddenly when you have，you know，that good feeling within yourself。and
    you don't even need a relationship anymore，you're， not even thinking about a relationship。in
    fact，a relationship has hit a point where it's kind of a stretch for you，like，uh。do
    I want to do this right now？I'm so fulfilled in my life，this is a stretch，and
    suddenly。the girls that you meet，now they want to be your girlfriend。now you've
    got the girls popping up behind fire hydrants and jumping out of hedges trying
    to be your girlfriend。right？Because you have，this is the paradox，yeah，it's the
    ultimate paradox，the，you know。what do they say，the hungry don't get fed or something
    like that？And so basically。you want to achieve that self-affirmation，，and isn't
    it funny，because you'll start off like。I just want a girlfriend so bad，uh，I have
    to become self-fulfilled，fine，whatever it takes，man。
- text: I'll become self-fulfilled to get a girlfriend，and you'll be doing it for
    all the wrong reasons。but you know what，whatever works，whatever works，man，I mean，if
    that starts you off on the right path。and then you start to get a taste of self-fulfillment，and
    you start to really get into it。that could be the start of a beautiful thing。I
    guess what I'm saying is that，when they say that，like。you know，validation comes
    from within，or love comes from within，，like。that good feeling is something that
    you should feel about the world。and once you feel that about the whole world，then
    you can，you know，you can focus that on one person。and it's no longer needy，it's
    no longer attached，it's no longer codependent。It's almost like they say，if you
    have a bushel of flowers。it's when you clip that flower to try to make it yours，that
    it dies，alright？Because you're trying to say，that's mine，okay，and I'm gonna possess
    it，and I'm gonna create。I'm gonna allow that into my ego structure，and I'm gonna
    base my sense of who I am。base on my relationship，and if I were to lose it，it
    would be， horrible，but you know what。when you clip the flower and you try to make
    it yours，it just dies，right？You're suffocating it，okay？It's like a butterfly，you
    don't just grab it and crush it，you just let it stay there，alright？You know what
    I'm saying？That's what most guys do，they go，ugh，and then it's dead。What the fuck
    did I do，right？And that's where it goes wrong。So look，that good feeling。
- text: I want you guys to really think about this，and we talk about social conditioning
    earlier today。that's kind of how we're wrapping up。That good feeling that you
    feel，in your body。like just that fucking glow that you feel every day of your
    life。that's something that you have on your own，and most people rely on consumerism
    to get that。or rely on validation to get that，but that's something that comes
    from within。We're gonna talk tomorrow and the rest of these next few days about
    what that's really all about。okay？But really，I guess what I wanna say to you guys
    is I wanna get you more towards a mode of offering value。You're not walking up
    with a half-filled-up cup trying to say，like little Oliver， twist。you may have
    some more，right？You're not looking to self-seek in another person，alright？And
    I guess that that is when，you know，love will enter your life，alright？That's when
    that will come。okay？And when you come full circle。Now look，today，we've covered
    a lot of foundational stuff，alright？This is day one of four，and I love the fact
    that the four days allows us to look at these foundations really closely so that
    we can have them in mind as we go deeper down the road。，So，I'm gonna go into the
    rabbit hole over the next three days。Now，like I've told you，this is my。I guess
    my fifth time，depending on which ones you count，doing the seminar。and every time
    the guys have walked away on the first day kind of like，huh。this is really interesting。What
    am I gonna use this to apply to my life？
- text: And in the day two，three。and four，that's when the epiphanies are gonna start
    to build，okay？Every day that we do this。you know how a lot of time guys will give
    their best material on day one？This is the building material，alright？So，we are
    going deeper and deeper and deeper。。I want you guys to go out tonight，have a good
    time，and the lesson for tonight。what I really want you guys to think about，if
    we think about what lesson you guys are gonna take away from this tonight。is do
    what you wanna do，alright？My friend Alex，he says，I do what I want when I want。My
    friend Nathan。he says，I'm gonna be the person I'm meant to be，alright？My friend
    Tim，he says。don't give a fuck what anybody thinks of you，okay？And these are a
    lot of sort of catchphrases that we have。and we have these for very，very good
    reason。So，I want you guys to think tonight，。about the kind of behaviors that you
    have，when you're on your own，right？The kind of behaviors that you have，when you're
    being the kind of person that you wanna be。and I want you to communicate with
    everybody that way。I wanna think of how you feel when you feel good，and I want
    you to allow yourself to feel that way。alright？What we've done here is we've gone
    from social conditioning to a better place，right？We've looked at sort of the，you
    know，the ailments of social conditioning。and we've moved you towards a better
    place。，We've moved you maybe from here to here。and over the next few days，we wanna
    get you over to here，alright？So。
- text: I wanna thank you guys very much for coming out and listening today。and I
    want you guys to have an amazing night。Thank you very much。。
