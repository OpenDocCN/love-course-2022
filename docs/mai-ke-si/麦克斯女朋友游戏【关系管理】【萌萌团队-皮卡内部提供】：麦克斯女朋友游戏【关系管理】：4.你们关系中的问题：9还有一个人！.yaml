  text: '# 麦克斯女朋友游戏【关系管理】【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：麦克斯女朋友游戏【关系管理】：4.你们关系中的问题：9还有一个人！Oh no， there''s
    another guy。，Oh no， another guy。，What am I gonna do？，Oh my god。，Always remember，。it''s
    the most classic of classics shit tests，a girl can throw at you ever。，Honestly。I
    think at this point it''s hilarious。，Every time I see it， it''s hilarious。。Because
    at this point again， it''s so fucking obvious。，And also both low self-esteem。and
    high self-esteem girls will use it。，It''s a timeless classic。，It''s like Summer
    of 69 by that guy。。It''s a timeless classic。，Everybody knows it。，Everybody does
    it。，Summer of 69。，And yeah， like I said。both low self-esteem，and high self-esteem
    girls do it。，Now low self-esteem girls will do it。on a pretty much fucking daily
    basis。，It''s a wonderful red flag to get the fuck out of that relationship。，A$AP。，High
    self-esteem girls will use it occasionally。。My girlfriend has used it twice in
    the very long time，that we''ve been together。，One。she did it with this like crossfit
    guy or whatever the fuck。。There was like some guy who did like calisthenics at
    the gym。，And I mentioned that example earlier。。And she''s like，，That guy has really
    cool exercises。，Look at him。 It''s really hot too。，And yeah。and the second time
    she did it like，，Oh baby， I''m really sorry。。My ex-boyfriend has come to the party
    too。，Because he''s friends with one of my friends。。It was a nice shit test。，That
    is just basically， how do you say？，In a wonderfully elegant way，。she hid that
    shit test underneath the，，'
- summary: "-   当女友提到有另一个男人时，关键在于如何反应，要意识到自己的价值。\n    1.  不仅仅是客观价值，比如谁更有钱、更高、更帅，而是你对她的价值。\n\
    \    2.  你知道如何让她满足，两人有美好经历，你处理她情绪的方式。\n    3.  不用担心其他男人的客观价值，对女孩来说重要的是你对她的价值。\n\
    -   在女孩不想和你交往时，要记住人们有不同的价值体系。\n    1.  就像我曾追求的那个女孩选择了修车工，虽然我客观上更有价值。\n    2. \
    \ 女孩在乎的是男人对她的价值，而不是客观价值。\n    3.  了解对方对你的价值是什么。"
  text: I'm sorry that the guy's coming。，But at the same time，。she looked at how is
    Max reacting。，And this is key here。。How to react when she mentions that there
    is another guy。，Really key， be aware of your own value。。And I'm not even talking
    about the objective value。，Who has a bigger dick？，Who has more money？。Who's taller？，Who's
    better looking？，Yada yada yada。。I'm actually talking about the value that you
    represent for her。，You know how to make her come。。The two of you have had wonderful
    experiences together。，The way you handle her emotions。。The way you're fucking
    alpha male。，Like again， that could be the richer guy that's taller，。better looking，
    et cetera。，But you just have so much more value for your girlfriend。。Because you
    know that。，Because you know how well you handle her。。How well you're steering
    that relationship。，So don't worry if the guy has objective better value。。Doesn't
    matter。，For the girl， it's the value for her。。That is by the way also if you watch
    the chapter on。when she doesn't want to have a relationship with you。。Remember
    what I said here is people have different values，systems。，It's exactly the same
    story。。Remember that girl that I said I really wanted her。，But then she chose
    the mechanic。。The fucking mechanic guy over me。，It's the same dynamic。。I objectively
    speaking have much more value than the guy。，But girls don't care about that。。They
    care about the value that the guy has for them。，Okay。，What do I feel like the
    guy value have？。Okay。，Understand。，
- summary: "-   总结：重要的是要注意自己的价值观，对女孩提到其他男人时要反应但不要反应过度。\n    1.  不要完全忽视她提到的其他男人，而是要承认并保持冷静。\n\
    \    2.  不要让这改变你的情绪，要表现得毫不在意。\n    3.  如果想展示最强大的力量，可以选择站在那个男人一边，这将展示你拥有的阿尔法框架。"
  text: So that is important。，Beware of your own value。。And also be responsive but
    not reactive。，By that I mean when she mentions another guy。。Don't just fully ignore
    it。，Just acknowledge it like oh cool。，There's another guy。。But don't let it change
    your mood。，Not at all。，Don't fucking let it change your mood。。Don't be fazed by
    it。，Again girls use that as a shit test。，Oh， there's this guy in the cinema。。He
    was really nice。，That's the sky at my work and they will fucking stare。at you
    to see how you react。，Don't ignore it because that's a little over，compensation。。Just
    acknowledge it。，Like oh yeah， cool。，That's cool。，Oh interesting。。And if you want
    to do the most powerful thing ever，on top of that is side with the guy。。So fucking
    powerful。，Like this is like literally the cherry on top of it。。Nothing shows the
    girl more how much you fucking，own your alpha frame than this。。So she's like there's
    this guy at my work。，He's really nice to me。，Herp de derp。，Jealousy， jealousy。right？，And
    you just like yeah， you're right。，He does sound like a totally awesome guy。，Hell
    man。。If I was a girl， I'd fucking throw my panties，on this motherfucker all day。。I
    would suck his dick for breakfast， man。，I don't give a shit or shit like oh my
    God， baby。，Like。you know， maybe you want to invite this guy，over to like a romantic
    dinner。，But yo， if you do that。make sure you're a really，nice girl and you cook
    for him and or you pay the，check。，Both examples。just random examples。，So you get
    the gist， right？。
- summary: "-   The underlying communication behind her test is to test the man's\
    \ confidence and reaction to competition.\n    1.  The test is to see if the man\

  text: What's the underlying communication behind her test？，Let's look at that。。The
    underlying communication behind her test is，basically， yo， boyfriend， how much
    of a man are，you？。Are you going to be thrown off by a little competition？。Whether
    that competition is actually even real or，not doesn't even matter， right？。Are
    you gonna be thrown off by that motherfucker？，More on that， by the way。in the
    how to pass her initial，test chapter and the general shit test chapter as well。。And
    what's the underlying communication behind your，reaction？，That is key。，So again。once
    that happens， it matters。，What's the underlying communication behind her。saying
    this and what's the underlying communication，behind your reaction？。The reaction
    should be something like， oh， there's，another guy。，Ha， that's funny。，Oh， that's
    cool。。Yeah， I didn't even realize he's supposed to be，competition。，Like， oh， oh，
    oh， oh。it's supposed to be，competition。，Oh shit。，Oh， I'm sorry。，I'm sorry。，Yeah，
    oh fuck。，Oh my God。。I just kind of missed that， right？，But hey， he's probably
    a cool dude。，So no hard feelings。。Let's invite him over， right？，Best fucking communication。，Best
    fucking communication ever， right？。If you communicate that， you're good to fucking
    go。，More on that， however。in the jealousy chapter as well。，You can look those
    up。。So that is how you deal with if there's another fucking，guy。，And if there's
    another fucking guy。where it's like，super serious and the girl thinks like， well，
    I，
