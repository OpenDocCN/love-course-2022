    is super important，So again，By the way，We're flying to New York，So sick，So again。By
    the way，It's extremely powerful，If you use it in the right manner，And another
    one。That is really really powerful，Is actually，You know，For example，Oh I'm actually
    quite nerdy。The underlying communication，Of what you use actually is，You're giving
    her info。That you don't give to others，A。k。a，You're a special girl，Okay，So actually，I'm
    really really nerdy。This is especially powerful，When the girl is like，Well you

  text: We've been thinking about you，For a very very long time。This is some hidden
    info，That not many people know about me，But，There it is。And it makes the argument，That
    you're going to bring，Much more powerful，Similar to that is。Can I be honest with
    you，The can I be honest with you，Is extremely powerful，In examples like。Can I
    be honest with you，I'm totally enjoying this，What it does is，Amplifies any compliment。That
    you're about to give，Can I be honest with you，I totally love the time with you。Can
    I be honest with you，Your cooking is impeccable right，The underlying communication
    here is。My compliments are very rare，And you just deserve one，And again，It amplifies
    the compliment。Especially powerful，When you want to open yourself up more，Then
    I would always use things like。Actually，And，Can I be honest with you，Ecetera，And
    again，Amplifies that，Let me talk about。The power of what you don't say，Because
    there's a，You know have you ever said that。Like the right words are silver，But
    silence can be gold，Or some bullshit like that，It's true。There's a lot of power，In
    the things that you don't say，So talking about the seeking for。Raport tonality，Like
    hey really，Now interesting enough，In a pick up context。You've heard us bad mouth，This
    kind of tonality，Like hey guys，Can I have your number。We don't do that，In the

  text: It actually works，For example，When you have too much value。And the girl feels
    like，You're too much high up there，And she feels a little bit inferior。Or a little
    intimidated by a value，You can use the seeking for，Raport tonality，Like actually。Can
    I be honest with you，So much more powerful，If you combine it，For example with
    the power of words。Now the slightly challenging tonality，That we usually use in
    pick up context，You can use that too。If you want to tease her，Or you want to use
    your，You want to emphasize your alpha status。So you play around with these tonalities，Use
    them at the right way，Oh she needs more value of you。More attraction，Use the slightly
    challenging tonality down，Or you want to open yourself up more。You feel like she's
    intimidated by your value，Maybe you want to go up with a little bit，Okay。That's
    the seeking for a port tonality，You can use those，Play around with them。And use
    them in your favor，Now I also want to say，With the power of what you don't say
    is。Let her speak，So many guys，It's crazy they get overly defensive。When the girl
    is talking about an issue，For example，And then they interrupt her。Because like
    oh I want to fix it，I want to fix it，I want to fix it，Right there exactly like
    again。Fixing psychotherapy mode，Interrupt her，It's not important，Let's go fix
    shit right。Whereas what they again don't realize like，Girls enjoy the hell out
    of their emotions。Both they're good emotions，As well as they're bad emotions，And
    by interrupting her。
- summary: '-   你不仅剥夺了她享受两种情感的乐趣，还在传达她的话不重要，与任何人都有冲突，尤其是与女友。要先倾听，听她在说什么。每次打断她，都在表明她的话对我不重要。要训练自己倾听，尽可能多地倾听。2009年，我作为音乐记者采访了许多英雄，包括乔·萨特里亚尼。他是世界上最好的吉他手之一，是我敬仰的人。他是第一个真正倾听每个问题的人。其他摇滚明星可能会打断，但他会静静地听每个问题。'
  text: Not only are you depriving her，Of the enjoyment of both of her emotions。But
    you're also communicating that，What she's saying is not important，Whatever you
    have conflict。In general with anybody，But especially with your girlfriend，Listen
    first，Listen to what she's saying。Any single time you're interrupting her，You're
    showing her，What you say is not important for me。I don't give a fuck，You got to
    train yourself to listen，As much as you can，Best example of that is。Back in the
    days，I think it was in 2009，I was working as a music journalist。I was interviewing
    a lot of my childhood heroes，A lot of my current heroes etc。Amongst them was Joe
    Satriani，Commonly referred to as，The best guitarist in the world。One of the best
    guitarists in the world，Either way a fucking genius，And the guy I look up to。And
    I've interviewed a lot of people，I've interviewed a lot of rock stars，I've interviewed
    Korn。Papa Roach，Trivium，Kilsridge Engage，Behemoth，Like I mean not like Metallica。But
    yo those guys are fucking famous，And this one always stood out，Joe Satriani，Because
    I came in。And he was I feel like，The first guy who truly listened，To every single
    question。Sometimes they're like，Oh I get what you're going to do，With this question。So
    let me just jump in and answer it，Let me just interrupt you right，And it's okay
    I mean。The rock stars can do whatever the fuck they want，But Joe Satriani he would
    sit there。And he would be like，Mhm，Mhm，And he would listen to every fucking question。

  text: No matter how basic the question was，Like how do you like Vienna，Oh I think
    it's a great city。Tell me about your new album，You just brought your new album
    out right，That is correct。Yeah the new album does this this，It was like he was
    listening so much，He made me feel so important。And after that I became just this
    uber fan，I'm like Joe Satriani，Best guitarist in the world。Nice to speak to you，Nice
    to sky as well，And again it gives you so much more importance。Than you think you
    might have，It gives that other people，The other person that。That feeling of hey
    you matter，What you say matters to me，And that's extremely powerful。In your relationship，Which
    brings me to the next point，When she has her freak out moments。Every any girl
    has，Literally every fucking girl，Has a freak out moments，Even high self-esteem
    women。It's totally normal，It's part of being a woman，It's part of enjoying their
    emotions right。It's recycling their emotions etc，So when she has a little freak
    out moment，I do the falling。And I'm talking about cute little freak out moments，Not
    like my father died oh my god。You know like that's a legit freak out moment，I'm
    talking about like a cute little freak out moment。Like oh my god I don't know
    what to press the button，On the computer and shit like that。That's a little freak
    out moment，What I do here is the following。I pace I lead and I top her emotions，Again
    pacing leading emotions，Again her freaking out。It's part of enjoying her emotions，

  text: Sometimes they need a little bad emotions，On top of that into it。So you do
    pacing leading，You add a little bit of bad emotions into it，For example pacing
    her first。By saying yeah I understand，It totally feels like X Y Z right，And all
    you're left thinking is X Y Z。So again repeating what she's saying，Repeating what
    she's feeling，Now you're getting into leading。But then you realize that，You know
    nothing can happen to you，And that I'm always there for you。And the world is great，And
    that we're in this together，And that there's people supporting you。So now you're
    leading，Again oh I understand that，You probably feel like this。And it makes you
    think that，But then you understand，That the world is great。And that it always
    ends up well，And the good guys always win，And you know ba ba ba ba ba。So you lead
    her to a more positive outcome，And then what you can do is obviously。You can add
    physicality，You can add eye contact，You can add a little emphasizing pause。And
    then you say something funny，To give her that emotion，Then you tease her a little
    bit。To give her that emotion，Until you catch me with the cleaning lady，And found
    out that I have。Seven half Mexican children，I have to pay for，Poo emotions right，So
    again whatever her problem is。Pace her first，Make her understand that you understand
    her，Lead her to where you want to have her。And then give her the rest，With some
    fun teasing emotion。I'm gonna give you another example right here，So my girlfriend
    and I。

    not a single person in this world，That understands where I'm coming from，And what
    I'm doing。Except from my wife，She knows me，She gets me，And he just kind of，Mentioned

    wife hears it。And I looked over to her，And she was just like haha，Like she's like。It
    was a very subtle expression on her face，Of like oh I love him。And they've been
    together for a very long time，So it was like this totally romantic thing。And in
