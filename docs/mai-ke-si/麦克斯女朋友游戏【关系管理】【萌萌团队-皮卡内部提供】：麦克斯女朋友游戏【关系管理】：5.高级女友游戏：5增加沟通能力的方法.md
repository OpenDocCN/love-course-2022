# 麦克斯女朋友游戏【关系管理】【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：麦克斯女朋友游戏【关系管理】：5.高级女友游戏：5增加沟通能力的方法

好，在這段影片中，我們會談談，提升了溝通技巧，我把這段影片放在高級層次，因為這是一個特別的影片，可以使用很多小小的小小的，可以和女朋友溝通得到效果，有效，而且在一個真實的，心中的方式。

我把這段影片放在高級層次，因為我說，只有小女孩，如果真的想要這件事，會想要這段影片，所以，這是我的禮物給你，讓我們開始，所以，我必須說，對於溝通效果來說，溝通是非常輕微的，溝通效果是不常見的，不常見的。

像是很明顯的，很激烈的，不，不，溝通是非常輕微的，這就是讓溝通非常有效的，溝通效果正確的，是女生追求你的原因，是女生為某些政治人員投票，這是讓人買你的東西的決定因素，這就是溝通效果，如果你用得正確。

所以，我們先說說第一件事，就是溝通是讓人追求你的原因，我們談過了這個，她有問題的篇文，當女生在溝通時，她會問你，你怎麼做，當女生在溝通時，她不想你解決，她想在她的情緒中沉浸，讓她能夠感受到她的情緒。

所以，我會這樣做，當女朋友在溝通時，首先，第一件事，我會重複她剛才說的，在同一種語言上，所以，她會強調，她的情緒是正確的，我們來說，可能不是，你會問，她為什麼會這樣，她需要的信息是正確的，女生在溝通時。

她想在正確的情況下，女生會更加同意，女生的情緒也會有更高的，社交平衡，對於男生來說，因為女生會不停的磨擦，我正確嗎？，我不正確嗎？，我正確嗎？，我不正確嗎？，如果你想深入解釋，去看這本書，它叫什麼？。

《女性腦袋》，這是我們在這部影片中所提到的，這本書很不錯，裡面她說的是，女性的眼睛，這是女性的女性腦袋，女性腦袋的孩子，會看著他們的父母的臉，10至20倍多，那男性腦袋的孩子，為什麼？，因為他們的臉。

他們想要看著臉，所以，你會聽到，女朋友在說，有些事情會令她生氣，我不會說，她在生活中的困難，會損壞她的生活，我會說一些事情，例如，天啊，珍妮在工作上，說了一件事，她想明白，我的情緒是否適合她，所以。

你再次重複，她說的東西，在同一種語言上，你會給她那些情緒，你會說，你適合她，例如，她說，天啊，珍妮說我胖，她怎麼敢？，你會說，珍妮說你胖，她怎麼敢？，她只是重複，她說她的情緒，是否適合她，然後，她會說。

她的情緒，是否適合她，她的情緒，謝謝，所以，你給她她想要的東西，再加上，如果你想要，如果你想要重複她，問她，她覺得如何，重複她的情緒，所以，天啊，珍妮說，她是你胖的，你怎麼敢？，你覺得如何？，所以。

重複她的情緒，如果你想要更加重複，你可以說，你朋友們怎麼想要那些？，你女朋友們怎麼想要那些？，這就代表，你鼓勵她，向她展示她的社交信仰，天啊，女朋友完全同意，因此，這真是非常強烈，這就代表。

你非常有效地，交流，當你的女朋友，在討論她的事情時，會令她生氣，所以，再一次，向她展示她的情緒，是否適合她，再加上，重複她的情緒，然後再給她一個機會，去向她展示她的社交信仰，她在討論什麼？，這很棒。

你的女朋友會為你帶來愛，而且，你看，我在整個節目中提到，你能給她一些東西，是沒有人能給她的，你會把女朋友給你，她會更加吸引你，你明白嗎？，如果他們，如果他們帶來這個，熱熱的，足球，專業的，富豪的人。

他可能比我高，在社交上，他可能有一個，更好的身體，更大的嘴巴，更多的錢，更多的社交信仰，這些都可以，但他能給她，這些小小的東西，包括你的遊戲，這些小小的，交流技巧，他不能給她，在深深的內心中。

她會感覺到，這空虛，這空虛的感覺，當她來自於滿足，她可能會在外面，滿足，酒店，更好的地方，飛到世界上，但她能否，滿足在內心，她只能是，一個像你，她能把女朋友的遊戲下降，如果你想，我們來談談。

接下來的問題，如何得到滿足，這很奇怪，因為，你女朋友，可能會是一個很好的女朋友，她會給你滿足，等等，很多男人，當他們被滿足，他們會看待，她會給她滿足，但這完全，完全不合理，你女朋友，會給你滿足。

因為她想給你滿足，而不是因為她在，為她的滿足招募，低自尊女人會這樣，你女朋友，不會低自尊，至少，在這個時候，我希望她不會，很多男人會說，她很棒，你也很棒，女朋友會說，謝謝，但你很棒，男朋友會說。

你也很棒，不，你很棒，我只是想說，讓我給你滿足，拜託，男人會不停地看見，這是她的責任，要給她滿足，你知道嗎，你不，這是你做的，你感謝她，你獲得她滿足，這就是結束了，謝謝，你很棒說這話，來吧，親一個，完。

好嗎，這也很重要，因為，如果你給她滿足，當她給你滿足，她會把你的滿足，帶走，她會失去意義，所以，當她給你滿足，你給她滿足，當你感覺到，這就像是，從一個真正的，正確的角度，這就像是，從一個真正的正確角度。

我們來談談，接下來的概念，我稱之為，語言力量，如果你是自然的，你可能知道，自然的部分，這是一個，自然的非常深刻的，篇文，語言力量，你能說什麼，等等，我想在這部分，也要說明，女朋友遊戲的場面。

在女朋友遊戲的場面，最強的部分，如果你想深入看，你可以去看自然的，我們會在這裡，可以在這裡看嗎，可以在這裡看嗎，把它打開，所以他們會看到，自然的部分，你會看到，你會看到，你會看到，如果你在這影片下方。

按下這個按鈕，你會看到，如果你不想要，你會看到，但總之，這裡有最強的部分，當它說出，語言力量的時候，第一，By the way，By the way，這很重要，因為我用它來，提升超級精彩的東西，我會做。

來驚喜她，例如，例如，例如，By the way，Pack your stuff，We're going on vacation，For the weekend。

It's so fucking powerful，Because when you say，By the way，She will assume，It's nothing important。

But she will see，It is super important，So again，By the way，We're flying to New York，So sick，So again。

By the way，It's extremely powerful，If you use it in the right manner，And another one。

That is really really powerful，Is actually，You know，For example，Oh I'm actually quite nerdy。

The underlying communication，Of what you use actually is，You're giving her info。

That you don't give to others，A。k。a，You're a special girl，Okay，So actually，I'm really really nerdy。

This is especially powerful，When the girl is like，Well you know，You probably don't even miss me。

Duh duh duh，Actually，We've been thinking about you，For a very very long time。

This is some hidden info，That not many people know about me，But，There it is。

And it makes the argument，That you're going to bring，Much more powerful，Similar to that is。

Can I be honest with you，The can I be honest with you，Is extremely powerful，In examples like。

Can I be honest with you，I'm totally enjoying this，What it does is，Amplifies any compliment。

That you're about to give，Can I be honest with you，I totally love the time with you。

Can I be honest with you，Your cooking is impeccable right，The underlying communication here is。

My compliments are very rare，And you just deserve one，And again，It amplifies the compliment。

Especially powerful，When you want to open yourself up more，Then I would always use things like。

Actually，And，Can I be honest with you，Ecetera，And again，Amplifies that，Let me talk about。

The power of what you don't say，Because there's a，You know have you ever said that。

Like the right words are silver，But silence can be gold，Or some bullshit like that，It's true。

There's a lot of power，In the things that you don't say，So talking about the seeking for。

Raport tonality，Like hey really，Now interesting enough，In a pick up context。

You've heard us bad mouth，This kind of tonality，Like hey guys，Can I have your number。

We don't do that，In the pick up context，Like you want to have，The slightly challenging tonality。

Hey let's exchange numbers，Right that's much more attractive，But if used correctly。

In the girlfriend game context，It actually works，For example，When you have too much value。

And the girl feels like，You're too much high up there，And she feels a little bit inferior。

Or a little intimidated by a value，You can use the seeking for，Raport tonality，Like actually。

Can I be honest with you，So much more powerful，If you combine it，For example with the power of words。

Now the slightly challenging tonality，That we usually use in pick up context，You can use that too。

If you want to tease her，Or you want to use your，You want to emphasize your alpha status。

So you play around with these tonalities，Use them at the right way，Oh she needs more value of you。

More attraction，Use the slightly challenging tonality down，Or you want to open yourself up more。

You feel like she's intimidated by your value，Maybe you want to go up with a little bit，Okay。

That's the seeking for a port tonality，You can use those，Play around with them。

And use them in your favor，Now I also want to say，With the power of what you don't say is。

Let her speak，So many guys，It's crazy they get overly defensive。

When the girl is talking about an issue，For example，And then they interrupt her。

Because like oh I want to fix it，I want to fix it，I want to fix it，Right there exactly like again。

Fixing psychotherapy mode，Interrupt her，It's not important，Let's go fix shit right。

Whereas what they again don't realize like，Girls enjoy the hell out of their emotions。

Both they're good emotions，As well as they're bad emotions，And by interrupting her。

Not only are you depriving her，Of the enjoyment of both of her emotions。

But you're also communicating that，What she's saying is not important，Whatever you have conflict。

In general with anybody，But especially with your girlfriend，Listen first，Listen to what she's saying。

Any single time you're interrupting her，You're showing her，What you say is not important for me。

I don't give a fuck，You got to train yourself to listen，As much as you can，Best example of that is。

Back in the days，I think it was in 2009，I was working as a music journalist。

I was interviewing a lot of my childhood heroes，A lot of my current heroes etc。

Amongst them was Joe Satriani，Commonly referred to as，The best guitarist in the world。

One of the best guitarists in the world，Either way a fucking genius，And the guy I look up to。

And I've interviewed a lot of people，I've interviewed a lot of rock stars，I've interviewed Korn。

Papa Roach，Trivium，Kilsridge Engage，Behemoth，Like I mean not like Metallica。

But yo those guys are fucking famous，And this one always stood out，Joe Satriani，Because I came in。

And he was I feel like，The first guy who truly listened，To every single question。

Sometimes they're like，Oh I get what you're going to do，With this question。

So let me just jump in and answer it，Let me just interrupt you right，And it's okay I mean。

The rock stars can do whatever the fuck they want，But Joe Satriani he would sit there。

And he would be like，Mhm，Mhm，And he would listen to every fucking question。

No matter how basic the question was，Like how do you like Vienna，Oh I think it's a great city。

Tell me about your new album，You just brought your new album out right，That is correct。

Yeah the new album does this this，It was like he was listening so much，He made me feel so important。

And after that I became just this uber fan，I'm like Joe Satriani，Best guitarist in the world。

Nice to speak to you，Nice to sky as well，And again it gives you so much more importance。

Than you think you might have，It gives that other people，The other person that。

That feeling of hey you matter，What you say matters to me，And that's extremely powerful。

In your relationship，Which brings me to the next point，When she has her freak out moments。

Every any girl has，Literally every fucking girl，Has a freak out moments，Even high self-esteem women。

It's totally normal，It's part of being a woman，It's part of enjoying their emotions right。

It's recycling their emotions etc，So when she has a little freak out moment，I do the falling。

And I'm talking about cute little freak out moments，Not like my father died oh my god。

You know like that's a legit freak out moment，I'm talking about like a cute little freak out moment。

Like oh my god I don't know what to press the button，On the computer and shit like that。

That's a little freak out moment，What I do here is the following。

I pace I lead and I top her emotions，Again pacing leading emotions，Again her freaking out。

It's part of enjoying her emotions，Sometimes they need a little bad emotions，On top of that into it。

So you do pacing leading，You add a little bit of bad emotions into it，For example pacing her first。

By saying yeah I understand，It totally feels like X Y Z right，And all you're left thinking is X Y Z。

So again repeating what she's saying，Repeating what she's feeling，Now you're getting into leading。

But then you realize that，You know nothing can happen to you，And that I'm always there for you。

And the world is great，And that we're in this together，And that there's people supporting you。

So now you're leading，Again oh I understand that，You probably feel like this。

And it makes you think that，But then you understand，That the world is great。

And that it always ends up well，And the good guys always win，And you know ba ba ba ba ba。

So you lead her to a more positive outcome，And then what you can do is obviously。

You can add physicality，You can add eye contact，You can add a little emphasizing pause。

And then you say something funny，To give her that emotion，Then you tease her a little bit。

To give her that emotion，Until you catch me with the cleaning lady，And found out that I have。

Seven half Mexican children，I have to pay for，Poo emotions right，So again whatever her problem is。

Pace her first，Make her understand that you understand her，Lead her to where you want to have her。

And then give her the rest，With some fun teasing emotion。

I'm gonna give you another example right here，So my girlfriend and I。

We're planning to go on a vacation right，And that vacation is like，Two months away at that point。

And she's freaking out，Because we haven't bought the flights yet。

So she has a little freak out moment，Which is totally cute，I totally love it。

I live for these little moments，And she's like oh my god，We got to book the flights。

We got to book the flights，You got to do this right now freaking out，So what I did is。

Step in and I'm like yes baby，You're totally excited right。

You feel like you don't want to miss anything，Or book too late right，I understand that pacing。

But then you realize how much fun we'll have，And that we're already booking everything，Super early。

That we got tons of time，And it feels super safe，And all you're left is。

You can be excited for a little travel，That is leading right，Leading her to like a positive outcome。

But actually，Can I tell you something，As you can see，I use the power of words actually。

Can I tell you something，Me and Mike，Mike is the guy that books our travels，Me and Mike。

We've decided，We're going to Barcelona together，Without you，You know，What me and Mike have is real。

And I don't want to do，I don't want this to be disturbed by you，It's gonna be so nice。

And Mike is just really special for me，At this point my girlfriend is laughing。

Like boxing me in the shoulder，Like having a good fucking time，Because again，I affected。

I communicated efficiently，Effectively，Okay，I communicated to understand her by pacing。

I communicated her towards the feeling，That I want her to have，Which is safety，I understand you。

Come down with my leading，And then I spike her emotions，By cracking a little joke。

About me and Mike being a gay couple，And wanting to go there without her，Pacing，Leading。

Throwing in extra emotions，Pacing，Leading，Throwing in extra emotions，Massively powerful。

And honestly again，You might be like，Okay that's like a little thing。

I'll use it like maybe once a week，Dir，But it's these small things add up。

To a relationship being amazing，It's an amazing experience for her，And also for you，Because now。

When you communicate，Effectively with your girlfriend，What she does is。

She unleashes her female emotions on you，It's back and forth，It's giving and taking。

Giving and taking，And she gives you youth，And feminine energy back。

And both of you are just profiting，From each other like crazy，It's a wonderful little thing。

Now last but not least，I want to talk about outside communication，Basically，The things that you say。

Outside of the relationship，But you know she's gonna hear later。

So things you say to a friend of hers，And you know she's gonna tell her that。

Things you say to your friends，While she's kind of in earshot，And she's kind of getting it。

It's a wonderful little thing to say，Because it looks less needy。

Because you're not saying it directly to her，But at the same time she hears it。

And if she hears it from other people，It comes across as very very nice。

So when you want to say nice things，Tell that nice thing to her family，Or to her best friend。

Because they will relay it to her，And then it will like，Oh my god he said that，So much more powerful。

One of the curious things I've ever heard was，I was attending a seminar at my university。

I forgot what it was，I think it was a seminar about，Fuck man about teaching，Some bullshit。

I had to study，While I was studying Latin and English，And it was led by a guy and his wife。

They were both professors in the same field，And they were kind of running the seminar together。

And then one of the last seminars，The guy said，I can't remember what we talked about。

But his wife is like standing in the room，And he's talking and he's like，You know what。

You guys don't understand really what I'm doing，Nobody understands me。

There's not a single person in this world，That understands where I'm coming from，And what I'm doing。

Except from my wife，She knows me，She gets me，And he just kind of，Mentioned it on the go。

Like by the way，And I thought like dude，He tells us that，But his wife hears it。

And I looked over to her，And she was just like haha，Like she's like。

It was a very subtle expression on her face，Of like oh I love him。

And they've been together for a very long time，So it was like this totally romantic thing。

And in my head I'm like，Why is it so powerful，And I realized，It's so powerful。

Because he's not saying it to her，He's saying it to us，But she hears it。

Which makes it extremely fucking powerful，And in my head，I'm like this is really cute。

And then years later，With my current girlfriend，I unknowingly did the same，I was。

It was kind of funny，I can't remember who I talked to，I think it was Owen or Luke。

And I was talking to them，We were all hanging out in Hawaii together。

And my girlfriend was at the same table，But she was like doing her thing，And I was talking to Luke。

And I told him the story，How I met my girlfriend，And how I thought，Like in the very beginning。

I'm like oh my god，She's so beautiful，She's so hot，I totally want to make her my girlfriend。

How I'm like churning out，And shit like that，And then the first date，And then how she impressed me。

With being awesome，And how she passes all my tests，And how I was so impressed。

And then I totally loved her，For a very long time already，And I'm telling that to Luke。

And we're kind of joking about it，And laughing about it，But she heard it。

And she's like that is so cute baby，And I'm like，You're not supposed to fucking hear that。

But it was that much more powerful，Because I related to my friend，Not to her，But she was an eye。

Ear sight，Ear shot，Right，It's extremely powerful，Because you're not saying it，To impress her。

Because you're saying it，From a genuine perspective，Because you wanted to share it，With someone。

Someone else other than her，And that my friend is，Extremely effective communication hacks。

That you can add，Sprinkle them in，Into your relationship，And that way，You give her what she wants。

That nobody else can give her，Not the rich guy，Not the taller guy，Not the guy with the bigger dick。

But only you，Because you know，Girlfriend game at its finest。

GG。
