    one。，This is one I absolutely love。，This is what I call the dumb luck response。。This
    is just a name I came up for this。，But a couple of things。，There''s two areas
    of this。。They both have to do with a bartender in my example。，But it occurs in
    all kinds of areas of life。。So let''s talk about bartenders。，Why are bartenders
    perceived as attractive people。in bar and club life？，Why does that happen？，Is
    a bartender like a particularly like super desirable job？，Did he go to years of
    college to get it？，Does he have like a ton of special skills？，Not really。。I mean，
    he went to bartending school probably。，Maybe。，Sometimes yes， sometimes no even。。He
    knows how to mix drinks。，And in general， they hire people that are relatively。personable
    for it and like congruent with the image，of the club。。So they''re hiring like
    a slightly cool person。，But is bartender or should bartender be a really high。status
    job？，Probably not。，But a lot of girls get serious， serious crushes on， bartenders
    at the bar。right？，And whether they act on them or not or whatever。，So why is that？。Why
    is it that bartenders get this level of attraction？，Well， here''s what''s happening
    at the bar，。especially in a crowded bar。，So you have maybe one bartender and six
    or seven。people trying to order a drink。，And they''re trying to get his attention。。And
    he is methodically slowly going about dealing，with them。。They appreciate him when
    he does deal with them。，'
- text: They pay him for dealing with them， right？。And then more people come to clamor
    for his attention，throughout the night。。So when a girl is watching this，，logically
    in the 21st century，。she knows that the bartender is just doing his job。，But emotionally，
    what is she seeing？。She's seeing everybody responding to this guy。，She's seeing
    everybody seek this guy's attention。。And this guy be very selective about who
    he's giving， his attention to。。He's seeing everybody appreciate this guy。，And
    this guy ignore everybody else or not ignore him。fully， but seem to be ignoring
    them more than they're， ignoring him， right？。Paying less attention to them。，And
    yet it's working out well for him。，He's getting away with it，etc。。So this makes
    him be perceived as higher value，and actually can make girls get kind of unreasonable。crushes
    on bartenders，，even if they've never talked to him or never even，interacted with
    them。。So that's dumb luck responsiveness number one。，Dumb luck responsiveness
    with the bartender version。two is this。，Let's say you're out at a bar and you
    meet a girl。and you've been talking for a little bit，and she's like semi hooked，
    right？。But it's at a point where standing in one place，isn't really the right
    thing。。And deepening the conversation by buying some more time，for yourself will
    be a good move。。And maybe even she's with her friends。，And so by going to the
    bar，。you're able to get away from the friends，and get a one-on-one conversation。where
    maybe you can escalate。，
- text: So there's all these good reasons，to take a girl to the bar。。So you walk the
    girl over to the bar，with the idea of getting a drink。and you run into the scenario
    I just talked about，，which is one bartender or a few bartenders。and a lot of people
    trying to get drinks，from a few bartenders。。So everybody's clamoring for their
    attention。，Question is what happens to you in this situation？。Well， what happens
    to you is you're in a weird spot。because if you don't try and get the bartender's
    attention，，there's 10 other guys who are，。or guys and girls，，and they're gonna
    get his attention，because they're trying。。And he just is trying to be efficient，and
    trying to serve the people，that are trying to buy drinks。。So he just being natural，is
    going to sort of ignore you。，And what's the girl gonna see？。She's gonna see you
    getting ignored，and it's gonna make your value go down。。And the longer you stay
    there，and haven't gotten a drink，，you're gonna seem incompetent。。You're gonna
    seem like you invited her for a drink，and then you don't even know how to get
    a drink。。And that's gonna make your value go down as well。，Right？，And so it's
    pure dumb luck，。but standing there is making your value go down。，But you're also
    in the situation at that moment。where if you just try and get the bartender's
    attention，and don't get it，it's even worse。。And also if you try and get the bartender's
    attention，and ignore the girl，。unless she's pretty hooked already，，she may get
    bored，
- text: or it may down the interaction a little bit。。So there's this weird situation，where
    it's not your fault。，It's always just a fucked up situation。。But you're actually
    losing value，just because you're in this unusual situation。。And this idea of dumb
    luck responsiveness，，there's tons of it that occurs，in life。Right？。There's a reason
    why，，like say for example，you have a restaurant，that's managed by a guy。who's
    again is like 30s or 40s，that shouldn't，you know，。it's not really a particularly
    successful job，for him at that point in life。。Maybe it's kind of a low-end restaurant
    or whatever。，And then you have like the staff working there。that's like 18，19
    year old girls，，18，19，20 year old girls，，stuff like that。，And normally in life。they'd
    be like，，oh，burnout loser to this guy。，But because he is her manager at the restaurant。and
    because she's at the restaurant，and she sees him giving orders，and everybody obeying。and
    everyone responding to him，，she will instinctively tend to develop attraction。for
    this guy who logically，it doesn't make as much sense。，This is another situation。of
    that dumb luck responsiveness，because you're a leader in a situation。because people
    are responding to you，in a particular situation，，you're getting way more attraction。than
    you really should，under normal circumstances，or more attraction than logically。would
    seem to make sense。。
