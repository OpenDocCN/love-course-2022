  text: '# 托德-《吸引力解锁》：12-升级OK， next skill in escalation，So if you''re good at kissing，
    that''s attractive。If you know how to touch a girl in a way that feels good to
    her， that''s attractive。If you''re good in bed， that''s attractive，If you know
    how to ask your girl to go home with you in a way that makes her not feel slutty。that''s
    attractive，And why is that attractive？，Anyone？，Show you''ve been there before。It
    shows you''ve been with other girls，It''s a form of social proof， it''s a form
    of pre-selection。Does that make sense？，It shows you know what you''re doing，And
    the idea is， again。if you were attractive enough to have those experiences。it''s
    likely you''ll have an attractive child，Which means grandchildren for her。'
