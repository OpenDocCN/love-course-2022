  text: '# 03.麦迪森BOSS【萌萌团队-皮卡内部提供】：核心内容：14想法&执行力Execution，我醒來夢醒，思考，想想，生活，呼吸，擔心，計劃，計劃，Execution，Every
    asshole has an idea。Everybody has an asshole has an idea，I can totally be the
    best restaurant，I can do better。This restaurant sucks，Why does the subway have
    this turnstile thing like this。If I was in the subway guy I would do better，Look
    at the city so much construction。Why can''t they do construction better，So many
    potholes，Everybody''s got an idea of it，Everybody。But it really comes down to
    the execution of the idea，Because everybody has an opinion。Myself personally I''m
    going to tell you a crazy story，I invented the debit machine that''s mobile。It
    comes to your front door，Not the square payment one。But the one that you get when
    the pizza guy comes，And he''s asking for your debit card or your credit card。So
    I went to a company，One of the larger companies in the states，And I had this idea。And
    I wrote up the paperwork for it，We did it，I was about to patent it，But I couldn''t
    patent it。Because I didn''t have a working prototype，So the working prototype
    was very important for the patent。Because without a working prototype，It''s just
    an idea，Essentially there''s no execution in it。So I lost that，It would have been
    maybe almost billionaire，Multi-millionaire。Instead of hundreds thousandaire，Hundreds
    thousandaire or whatever，I don''t know，So that''s what it is。And it''s so key，It''s
    all about execution man，It''s all about execution。You think about the greatest
    basketball teams，Phil Jackson，'

    Pippen，Grant，Triangle offense or Michael Pippen。Steve Kerr，All these guys，It's
    all about the execution，The championship teams execute。They execute when they're
    winning，And they also have an execution plan，When they're losing。So you probably
    know what you would do，If you were fucking killing it，You're like if I'm killing
    it。I'd execute so well man，I'd just slay it，What's your plan for when you suck，We
    ask you that。How do you get back on track when you suck，When you are out of shape，How
    do you condition yourself。So you're around a lot of people that support you，How
    do you make it so that you get up。And you just stretch in your bedroom，One of
    the things I do a lot is。Like that's from the Heaven Pagan program，Get altitude
    I think or wake up productive。I would just have a morning ritual，I'd literally
    roll out of the bed。With pee to the against my alarm clock，Yelling at me，I got
    faith，I believe myself more than God。Roll to bed，Do push ups，Do crunches，Do I
    think planks for like，I don't know 30 seconds each。Then brush teeth shower，Instantly
    go for a run，Or go for a brush teeth shower。Come back fruit smoothie，That's it，And
    read a book，Read an audio book for 20 minutes。You can also incorporate，Your financial
    relationship，20 minutes of finances in the morning。Before you actually head out
    of your house，So what's your plan for when you're sucking。That was my plan，Got
    back right on point，Killing it，
- summary: "-   执行力是关键。无论是顺利还是困难，都要全力以赴。重要的是如何完成任务，而不仅仅是完成任务本身。要通过终点线，而不仅仅是看到终点线。要专注于完成，而不是什么都会但没有精通。要通过终点线，因为只有通过了，才能看到结果。\n\

  text: So it's all about the execution。Not just when things are going well，But also
    when things aren't going so well。What is your execution with yourself，So with
    execution，It's all about the finish line。It's only about passing the finish line，It's
    not even about the finish line at all。It's about passing it，Like literally passing
    the finish line，Everything you do before is useless。Useless，You ever hear this
    expression，Jack of all trades with a master of none，Very old expression。Just means
    that you are so good，At so many different things，But you can't master anything。You
    can't finish well，It's all about the finish，It's a lot like kung fu or anything
    like that。Or any kind of martial arts，That you hurt yourself，If you don't fully
    extend through it。Through the brick or the board，When you're breaking it，Just
    doing half way，It hurts you。So it's about passing the finish line，Because you
    don't see the results in an area。Until you actually pass it，Nobody cares if you
    don't pass the degree。Unless you go to a job in another area，And you do better，Nobody
    cares if you almost got the girl。Nobody cares if you almost，Went to the gym，Nobody
    cares if you almost got that。Vanguard index 500 investment，Nobody cares man，Nobody
    cares，But your mom，Your mom cares a little bit。But even not that much，Your mom
    wants you to be successful，She also wants you to be home with her。So nobody really
    cares，The execution is all about passing the finish line。I'm going to give you
    some great examples，

  text: I know a friend of mine，A buddy of mine。He actually used to be a music partner
    of mine，A music friend of mine。And lived in my house for a bit，This guy was amazing，Amazing。Probably
    the best music producer in Canada，When it came to urban music。That I've ever met
    in my entire life，He actually was amazingly good。He's so good that I've never
    met anybody better since then，Okay，He's a natural talent，Natural talent。He'd sit
    there and just make amazing music，You've never heard of，People would literally
    come and ask。If they could invest money into him，Because he was so good，It just
    sounded magical。But the challenge was he couldn't finish，He would start his musical
    projects。And then he would never put them out，Never ever ever ever put them out，Because
    he never put them out。Not a lot happened，People respected him when they came，Listen
    to his stuff，But he never put them out。Maybe he got two pieces of music out，In
    two or three or three or four years。When I say pieces I mean songs，That was it，Now
    when you're on the flip side。When you compare it to a guy like little Wayne，Which
    actually is kind of funny。Here you're gonna hear the story，A guy like little Wayne，Was
    just putting out music。Putting out music，Putting out music，And that's the guy
    who got really good at executing。So that he would just have better stuff to do，Now
    the funny thing with my friend，With the music。This guy，He actually was in a group
    with Drake，I won't even mention the name of the group。Because then you can research
    it，

  text: But he was in a group with Drake，Several years ago。Before Drake blew up，And
    part of the thing was，He didn't want him singing on the songs。And Drake wanted
    him to sing，So they had to fall out，Because Drake was about executing something。And
    getting it out，He wasn't into that，So the funny thing is that。He ended up going
    with little Wayne，Who was in the habit of executing new things。So you can see
    how that triangle worked out，You might know some musicians，Some artists。Some people
    that want to start businesses，Fail fast，They'll stay current as the expression
    goes。Learn fast，Like lean startup style，The more you fail，The faster you fail，The
    more you learn。That's a good thing，So you want to get in the habit of executing。Even
    if you don't understand everything fully，You execute，But you don't want to execute。At
    a point where，You're executing so hard，That you can't recuperate when you fuck
    up。You still want to be able to allow yourself，To fuck up every once in a while。And
    you don't just go bankrupt，Or mess your whole life up，You don't pass that。The
    idea is that you do want to keep executing，When the opportunity strikes。Because
    man life is so short，Life is so short，Another thing with executing is。You don't
    want to get in the habit of，False executing，Because the mind is crazy man。The
    way the mind works，Is that you can feel like you're executing，But you're not actually
    executing。Give you some examples here okay，So part of being an RSC instructor，Is
    all we'll look at，Your video。

  text: Your video log，Are you putting out videos regularly，It's a very very hard
    thing to do。And a lot of people will make videos，And not put them out，Because
    they don't want to get judged。By other people，They don't want to，You know whatever
    the reason is，The perfectionist。You just got to do it，Just put them out，Just put
    them out，Hustle hustle hustle，Crush it crush it。Put them out put them out，Alright，Think
    of a really really，Pretty girl that you know，Alright。Think of a pretty girl that
    you know，Think of a few，And think about their Instagram page。Or their Facebook
    page，Now if you're thinking about it，There's a little small box。That says the
    description，And I bet it says，CEO of myself，Or it could say，CEO of Makeup Artist
    Inc。When you know she works at Sephora，Or it could say that，She is you know。Having
    some sort of career ambition，And you know that it's，Grossly exaggerated right。Founder
    of blah blah blah blah media，When you know she doesn't even have a，Macbook Pro。I
    think that happens，Because as your brains get wired，For dopamine we get so much
    reinforcement。For feeling good and positive emotions，We tend to almost feel，We
    almost feel like we have。That success already，We almost feel like it's there，We
    almost feel like we're executing。So this is the crazy thing man，You can get high
    off the feeling，Of that you are maybe executing。When you're not，Like I'm executing，You
    know sit there like，Yeah I'm executing。There's gonna be times where like，We could
    do a photo shoot for Boss。

    no actionable items。Alright you have to have every，Similar idea in the meeting，It
    has to have an action item。And it has to be assigned to someone，Or else it doesn't
