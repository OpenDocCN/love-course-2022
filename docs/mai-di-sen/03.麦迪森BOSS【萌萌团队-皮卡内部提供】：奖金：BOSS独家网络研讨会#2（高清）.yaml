    hairs on your arm will stand up。At the terror in each sip and in each sun，Will
    you partake of that last offered cup。Or disappear into the potter''s ground，When
    the man will come to run，Hear the trumpets。hear the vibers，One hundred million
    angels singing，Multitudes are marching to the big kettle of rum。The voices calling
    voices crying，Hey， summer born every summer dying。It''s alpha and omega''s king
    will come，The world is in the thorn tree。The virgins are all trimming their wits，The
    world is in the thorn tree。It''s hard for thee to kick against the priests，Till
    armageddon， no shalom， no shalom。Then the father hen will call his chickens to
    dance，The wise men will bow down before the start。And at his feet they''ll catch
    the golden crown，When the man comes around，Whoever is unjust。let him be unjust
    too，Whoever is righteous， let him be righteous too，Whoever is filthy。let him be
    filthy still，Listen to the words long written down there，Indeed。when the man comes
    around，Somebody''s saying come to Paris。 Actually。I think I''m going to come visit
    Paris for fun later on in the year。。I have a tour where I''m going to do， I think
    I do London in the fall。，Then after London in the fall。I''ll try to do Paris。
    That''s my plan。，Check that out。 It''s really， really close。，Somebody said， hey。great
    talk。 I appreciate that。 Thank you， thank you， guys。，Welcome to the Boss VIP webinar。。'

    to quickly just talk about how to get the most out of Boss。，Some of you guys are
    asking。am I coming back to Zurich？，Yes， I'm coming back to Zurich in about eight
    months。nine months back in Zurich。，Do a hot seat， free tour， boot camp， everything
    like that。，Here we go。。First thing I want to talk about is I want to say， hopefully
    you guys are enjoying yourselves，。you're not on holiday， but you're on your weekend
    and getting out there and stuff like that。。Every once in a while I run into you
    guys out。，I run into you guys when I'm out。whatever city around the world it is，
    whatever country。。I'm in a club or I'm at a coffee shop or the mall。，When I'm
    there， I see guys doing games。。They come up to me like， yo， Madison。，Some guys
    are like， yo， I really， really like your stuff。。Some guys are like， hey， I got
    Boss。，There's actually some boot camp students lately that had Boss。right？，They
    come up to me and they're like， yo， I have Boss。，I have Boss。It's so great。I enjoy
    it。I'm like， awesome。，Then I give him a high five or whatever， a little pound，

    to the bottom。。It has every single thing that you need to be successful。at Code
    of Code Trick Up and just meeting women and attracting women。，Everything is in
    there。。If you follow it accordingly， all of your questions will be answered。。The
    way I did the program too was like， I did it in a way where。you might have some
    sticking points today。，This is you here today。。You might have some sticking points
    today。，But if you follow the process of the program in three to four months。，those
    sticking points don't even exist anymore。，Because your mindsets and your head
    spaces are changed。in the first few months so that later on if you follow the
    process of the program。you stick to the structure，，those sticking points don't
    exist anymore。。What do I mean by the process of Boss？，The program starts off。hero's
    journey talks about what your mission is。，It talks about finding out your standards。your
    values， your beliefs。，Then it talks about opening。，Opening and hooking a set。hooking
    a conversation。，Then it goes on to transitioning into a regular conversation。。Then
    it goes on to what？，It goes on to sexuality。，It goes on to having a long and deep
    conversation。。It goes on to displaying those standards and batteries。，It goes
    on to physical game。。

    follow the process as Jeff would say。，Stick to the program， execute the program。。Stick
    to the program， follow the process of it。，Now， on one hand， some guys might have
    Boss and say。how do I get the most out of it？，What I'm using， how do I learn from
    it？，Well。my recommendation is this。，This is the absolute epic fucking important
    recommendation is this。，Dude。pick a video。，Pick one video。，Whatever chapter you
    have trouble with。。Let's say you have trouble with opening， for example。。So it's
    like four videos in opening there or whatever the number is。，Pick one of those
    videos。。One of those videos in opening and practice that for a week。，Practice
    what it talks about。。Literally go out to the club and on Tuesday or whatever days
    you go out with， Thursday， Friday。Saturday， practice that one thing in the video
    all that week。，Then the next week， number two。week number two， you pick the next
    video， you watch it and you go and you practice that thing every single week。，The
    videos are so on point and so articulate that even in field eclipse at the end
    of the videos。。So you can compare what you're doing to what I'm doing in the video。，You
    can literally copy。。For training， we'll just start。，You can literally copy what
    I'm doing in the video just to start。。

    that for a week， etc。， etc。， etc。，Make a reminder in your phone that goes off
    at three o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning or one o'clock in
    the morning。，I don't know when clubs close in your city， but make a reminder an
    hour before the clubs close that this is the skill that you're working on for
    that night。，So pops up， remember you're working on statements， you're working
    on storytelling。you're working on observational things。，Whatever it is that you're
    working on。make a little reminder in your phone that pops up at one o'clock in
    the morning so you do that thing。，There's absolutely no reason why if you have
    this program you can't get good at this stuff。。The program is flawless。，The program
    is a fucking investment。，Honestly。it's an investment for the rest of your life。，It's
    like a game investment that will pay you back in one year。two years， three years。，It's
    so complete you could always come back to it year after year。。It's the best manifesto
    on pickup that I've ever seen in my entire life that exists。。That is in there
    for you guys。，Make a plan for yourself。。Make a plan for yourself how you will
    succeed， how you will correct sticking points and how you will correct blind spots。，That
