    my brain to，Want to get money，So at first I didn't even want to get it。right，My
    household， it was perceived that money is the，Rudable evil，So because of that。I
    thought that money wasn't a good thing，And I didn't want it。So I had to kind of

    school of thought says that you should。Really become a niche in an area，So if
    you do marketing，You want to maybe do internet marketing。If you do internet marketing，You
    maybe want to do AdWords，And if you do AdWords。Maybe want to do like certain things，

    to do，Maybe you want to do investing。Maybe you want to do pay stocks， right，You
    want to，The one school of thought says。You should really narrow down，To what your
    area is，And become an expert at it。Now there's another school of thought，That
    says you should understand。Many different areas and learn everything，Learn accounting，
    learn finance，Learn marketing。learn customer service，Learn sales especially，Sales
    is huge for anything you do。Because sales is kind of the lifeblood of any company，And
    any business。And if you have sales experience，You will do amazing， right，Even
    with RSE instructors。We train with some of the best sales people in the world，That
    train millionaires。And guys that have double digit，Multi-million dollar companies，We
    train with them in order to learn。How to be better at presenting ourselves，And
    relating to other people，So sales is a huge part。But so those are the two schools
    of thought， right，Number one is hey。Find a niche and really drill deep on that
    niche，Number two is learn a little bit of everything，Okay。I agree with both of
    them，No matter what avenue you choose，You still have to learn your strengths。So
    this is the process you can go through，To learn your strengths。The first thing
    I recommend is the Birkman test， okay，This is a test that tells you that。Your
    occupational talents that you have，You do a test，I think it's a little bit of
    time。You sit down in a private room，

    strengths。Your weaknesses，Your opportunities，Your threats，And it's worth investing
    in。Because you're going to have a benchmark，For your talents and your ambitions，And
    your passions， okay。It's I think about a hundred to two hundred dollars，I think
    for the test。Not sure the exact price depends on，Where you are in the world，But
    it's absolutely worth it。Think about it，How much would it cost in time saving，To
    know what your strengths are。How much would it save you financially，To know what
    your strengths are。And just shortcut everything that you're doing，The next thing
    I recommend you do。I've said this a bunch of times，Is get a book called Strength
    Finder 2。0，Okay， that's the new one。So Strength Finder， it sounds silly，I had
    this book for a while。And I didn't read it to one of my workplaces，Forced me to
    read this book，Strength Finder 2。0 is a book that allows you to，Essentially just
    look at all of your character strengths。So I think there's 30 character strengths，You
    can have，And it tells you your top five。After you do this online test，You get
    one code to do the test，You can use it once。You get one code and then that's it，So
    you do the Strength Finder test online。And allows you to figure out，What your
    top strengths are，

    Finder book is like $14，You can even go online to the website。I think for like
    $9，You don't have to buy the book，So it's really dirt cheap， okay。Last but not
    least，There's a thing by Tai Lopez，I think he calls it the Eulerian Destiny。I
    don't remember all the components，But there's a few good components here，That
    you want to apply。So there's four I think in the Eulerian Destiny，And there's
    three of them。That I want you to really think about， okay，What are you passionate
    about， right。List a few things that you're passionate about，Maybe three or four
    or five things。That you're passionate about，The other one would be，What do your
    friends compliment you on。What do your friends say is good about you，So your friends

    really good at talking to people。You're really good at making plans for us，You're
    really good at cooking cupcakes，Whatever it is。right，Your friends might say，That

    about strangers，And what do strangers say about you。All right，That's incredibly
    huge，That's probably the biggest one out of all three。What do strangers say about

    that completely exhausts you。So you have no energy for other things，That are important，But

    a month，For some extra work。Of what you want to do to build your brand，And really
    take the advantage。Of offering yourself and your services，Freely to those people，In

    maximizing your LinkedIn，Like you're fucking stupid，Just like straight up。Like
    it's the first place people go，I'll tell you why，LinkedIn is new Facebook。Because
    LinkedIn allows you to post articles，Right，You can post，You can join groups。So
    people have common interests，So for example，If you're into fashion，Fashion is
    your thing，You know。you're a designer of some kind，You can join a fashion group
    for your city，Or for your country。Where there's thousands of other people that
    are there。And you can post articles that you've written about the subject，Which
    helps you to find jobs。Helps you to find work，You know， you can go to hiring groups。You
    can go into people that are looking for work，All kinds of cool shit that's out
