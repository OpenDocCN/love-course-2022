    you guys being here，That was stupid， I''m sorry， that was stupid，I messed that
    up。Are you guys judging me？，Oh shit， you guys are probably judging me right now，Okay，I''m
    judging myself。I''m actually getting my head for real，Okay， that''s my intent，Fucked
    up， I can''t do it。Now my intent is just to share with you guys，Like like，Hey，
    what''s up guys。Welcome to RSD World Summit in Vegas，Thank you for being here，We
    have a fucking good time。We rock it tonight， alright，So do you hear the vision
    of my voice。When I block out those negative intents，I just cut them off to the
    side，Not to have them。I just push them to the side，Meditation helps with that
    a lot by the way。Meditation helps you to block out noise，Just not judge the noise
    in your head。So if you don''t meditate， I recommend you do，Definitely download
    an app called Headspace。The best meditation app I''ve ever used， okay，'

  text: I think I have like half of RSD on Headspace now。I should get an affiliate
    link for that shit， man，Damn， after this goes live。Headspace is gonna blow up，Shit，
    go to boss。rsdmadison。com，And click on that Headspace link，Nah， me。Alright， so
    you have intents，Next thing is even though you have those intents。You also have
    some fatigues going on in your mind，So the three fatigues are，Judgment fatigue。persona
    fatigue，And decision making fatigue，There's actually more than，There's actually
    a fourth。Which I call identity fatigue，Now I'll get into that in a bit。So judgment
    fatigue is you're wondering，If people are gonna judge you，Here I am doing an approach。Are
    you actually judging yourself，Am I gonna be good enough，Am I gonna fit in，Am I
    cool enough。Is this the right word，Does my hair look good，Am I wearing my right
    clothes，Does my gel look good。Do I have the right thing，Am I voice synality good，Am
    I smell like deodorant。Has she been approached today，Like judge， judge， judge，
    judge， judge，Stepping on your brain。You're stepping on your brain，Crushing your
    intents，The next one that's gonna kill your intent。Is gonna be persona fatigue，That's
    where you're worried about，What other people think of you。Is she out of my league，I've
    never had a girl like that before。Most guys can't walk up to a stunning girl，And
    keep their cool。Because they're doing judgment or persona fatigue，In their minds
    themselves，It wears them down， okay。Wears them down，You can't keep your cool，
- summary: "-   当你不断地自我评判时，会陷入自我评判的模式中。要摆脱这种模式，需要意识到自己的价值和勇气。决策疲劳会影响你的意图，使其变得薄弱无力。身份疲劳会限制你的行为和认知，但实际上游戏并不复杂，学会游戏的基本原则并实践它们。\n\
    \    1.  自我评判会让你陷入固定模式\n    2.  决策疲劳会削弱你的意图\n    3.  身份疲劳会限制你的行为和认知"
  text: If you're just judging yourself all the time。A lot of times on boot camp too，I'll
    send a guy，I'll send him to do the approach，He like comes back。I'm like how was
    that，He's like well you know，I guess it was okay，I'm like no motherfucker。It was
    a hundred out of ten，Who the fuck would have had the balls to do that，A hundred
    out of ten。You did it，Nobody does that sober，You did it，Well I guess no，I slap
    him on the back of the head。Get pissed off，Not really，So that's，He's judging himself，He's
    in a pattern of judging himself。You wanna get out of this pattern，Of judging yourself，
    okay。And the last one is decision making fatigue，Where you see the girl，And you
    wanna approach her。But you're like，I don't know，I should，Hey，What does that do
    to your intent，Shout it out guys。What does that do to your intent，Kills it yeah，It's
    because your intent's like。Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo，Bing，At the end，It's like，Woo
    woo woo woo woo woo woo woo。You can't have a strong intent after that，Your intent's
    all fucked up，It's all spineless。It's all pussyfooting around，You can't have a
    good intent after that。And the last one is identity fatigue，Where you're like，The
    story of me。The story of me up until this time，In my point in life，I've had this
    story，I'm not that person。I don't do that，I'm not that person，To be perfectly
    honest，Game is actually really fucking simple。It's pretty basic，You guys can learn，You
    will learn everything in game today。I will teach you everything in game today，

    of，This whole time，I'm fucking，Tinkerbell and shit，Right。Tinkerbell and shit，Tinkerbell
    is this bitch，RSC Tinkerbell，Okay，So that's what happens。You eventually learn
    to let go of your identity，Your identity is the only thing。That's holding you
    back，How hard is it to walk up to a girl，And say hello，Here's a two。Hey what's
    up how's it going，How relaxed with that，Here's a nine，Yeah hey what's up how's
    it going。Yeah yeah yeah，Here's a，Sofia Figuera，Hola，How's it going，Right。But then
    you have this identity of your story，Like I can't do that with that girl。I've
    always wanted to go on your mind，And kill your intent，So your channels of communication。Are
    not clear，That's what happens，
